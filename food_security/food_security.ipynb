hunger, food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition in all its forms by 2030 will \\nremain out of reach. Although the world \\nis recovering from the global pandemic, \\nthis is occurring unevenly across and \\nwithin countries. On top of this, the world \\nis grappling with the consequences of the \\nongoing war in Ukraine, which has shaken \\nfood and energy markets. \\nAgrifood systems remain highly vulnerable \\nto shocks and disruptions arising from \\nconflict, climate variability and extremes, and \\neconomic contraction. These factors, combined \\nwith growing inequities, keep challenging \\nthe capacity of agrifood systems to deliver \\nnutritious, safe and affordable diets for all. \\nThese major drivers of food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition are our “new normal”. We\\xa0have \\nno option but to redouble our efforts to \\ntransform agrifood systems and leverage them \\ntowards reaching the Sustainable Development \\nGoal 2 (SDG 2) targets.\\nGlobal hunger is still far above pre-pandemic \\nlevels. It is estimated that between 690 and \\n783\\xa0million people in the world faced hunger \\nin 2022. This is 122 million more people than \\nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, \\nthe increase in global hunger observed in the \\nlast two years has stalled and, in 2022, there \\nwere about 3.8 million fewer people suffering \\nfrom hunger than in 2021. The economic \\nrecovery from the pandemic has contributed \\nto this, but there is no doubt that the modest \\nprogress has been undermined by rising food \\nand energy prices magnified by the war in \\nUkraine. There is no room for complacency, \\nthough, as hunger is still on the rise throughout \\nAfrica, Western Asia and the Caribbean. \\nNo doubt, achieving the SDG target of Zero \\nHunger by 2030 poses a daunting challenge. \\nIndeed, it is projected that almost 600 million \\npeople will still be facing hunger in 2030. This \\nis 119 million more people than in a scenario \\nin which neither the COVID-19 pandemic nor \\nthe war in Ukraine had occurred, and around \\n23 million people more than in a scenario \\nwhere the war had not happened. \\nUnfortunately, our worries are not only \\ndue to hunger. In 2022, 2.4 billion people, \\ncomprising relatively more women and people \\nliving in rural areas, did not have access to \\nnutritious, safe and sufficient food all year \\nround. The persisting impact of the pandemic \\non people’s disposable income, the rising \\ncost of a healthy diet and the overall rise \\nin inflation also continued to leave billions \\nwithout access to an affordable healthy diet. \\nMillions of children under five years of age \\ncontinue to suffer from stunting (148\\xa0million), \\nwasting (45\\xa0million) and overweight \\n(37\\xa0million). Despite progress in reducing \\nchild undernutrition – both stunting and \\nwasting – the world is not on track to achieve \\nthe associated 2030 targets, and neither is \\nany region on track to attain the 2030 target \\nfor low birthweight, so closely linked to \\nthe nutrition of women before and during \\npregnancy. Steady progress is only seen on \\nlevels of exclusive breastfeeding.\\nThese numbers and trends may be a \\nconsiderable disappointment for us, but for the \\nchildren and people affected, they constitute \\nan underlying fact of their lives, and this fuels \\nour determination to keep finding solutions. \\nSince 2017 , when signs of increasing hunger \\nfirst began to appear, our organizations, \\nthrough this report, have provided in-depth \\nanalysis of the major drivers behind these \\nconcerning trends and evidence-based policy \\nrecommendations to address them. \\n| vii |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 9, 'page_label': 'viii'}, page_content='FOREWORD\\nWe have repeatedly highlighted that the \\nintensification and interaction of conflict, \\nclimate extremes and economic slowdowns \\nand downturns, combined with highly \\nunaffordable nutritious foods and growing \\ninequalities, are pushing us off track to meet \\nthe SDG 2 targets. While we must remain \\nsteadfast in taking bold targeted actions to \\nbuild resilience against these adversities, other \\nimportant megatrends must be considered. \\nUrbanization, for example, is one such \\nmegatrend that features as the theme of \\nthis year’s report. By 2050, almost seven in \\nten people are projected to live in cities; but \\neven today, this proportion is approximately \\n56 percent. Urbanization is shaping agrifood \\nsystems in ways we can only understand \\nthrough a rural–urban continuum lens, \\nencompassing everything from food \\nproduction, food processing, and food \\ndistribution, marketing and procurement, \\nto consumer behaviour. Due to population \\ngrowth, small and intermediate cities and \\nrural towns are increasingly bridging \\nthe space between rural areas and large \\nmetropolises. Hence, in our efforts to end \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition \\nin an urbanizing world, we can no longer \\noperate on the traditional assumption of a \\nrural–urban divide. \\nAs the world is urbanizing, food demand \\nand supply are changing rapidly across the \\nrural–urban continuum, challenging our \\ntraditional thinking. In some contexts, food \\npurchases are no longer high only among \\nurban households but also among rural \\nhouseholds living far from an urban centre. \\nMoreover, consumption of highly processed \\nfoods is also increasing in peri-urban and \\nrural areas of some countries, whereas \\nconsumption of vegetables, fruits, and fats \\nand oils is becoming more uniform across \\nthe rural–urban continuum. These important \\nchanges are affecting people’s food security \\nand nutrition in ways that differ depending on \\nwhere they live across this continuum.\\nTo overcome the challenges and seize the \\nopportunities that urbanization creates, \\nour actions, policy interventions and \\ninvestments will have to be informed by a \\nclear understanding of how the rural–urban \\ncontinuum and agrifood systems interact, \\nand how, given such interaction, urbanization \\naffects access to affordable healthy diets, and \\nconsequently food security and nutrition. \\nThe policy approach must go beyond rural \\nor urban silos and administrative borders \\nand will require strong and well-coordinated \\ngovernance mechanisms and institutions.\\nThe theme of this year’s report is also timely \\nand relevant for several other reasons. The \\npolicy recommendations can inform countries \\non what programmes, investments and actions \\ncan be effective and innovative for meeting the \\nSDG\\xa02 targets in the context of urbanization. \\nThey are also relevant for the achievement \\nof other SDGs, including not only SDG\\xa011 \\n(Sustainable Cities and Communities), but also \\nSDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG\\xa03 (Good Health and \\nWell-Being), SDG\\xa010 (Reduced Inequalities) \\nand SDG\\xa012 (Responsible Consumption \\nand Production).\\nRecent discussions at the United Nations \\nGeneral Assembly have raised the importance \\nof achieving Sustainable Cities and \\nCommunities (SDG 11), as this is closely \\nrelated to other important interconnected \\nissues, including poverty eradication, climate \\naction, migration, land degradation, economic \\nprosperity and creation of peaceful societies. \\nNonetheless, the related links between \\nurbanization and the affordability of healthy \\ndiets, and the resulting implications for food \\nsecurity and nutrition, have not been explored \\nin these discussions, and we hope this report \\n| viii |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 10, 'page_label': 'ix'}, page_content='helps bridge this important gap.

While the pandemic, the \\nensuing economic rebound, the war in Ukraine, \\nand soaring prices of food, agricultural inputs \\nand energy have all played out differently \\nacross regions with differing impacts, new \\nestimates indicate hunger is no longer on the \\nrise at the global level but is still far above \\npre-COVID-19-pandemic levels and far off track to \\nachieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2. \\nAs past editions of this report have highlighted, \\nthe intensification of the major drivers of food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition – conflict, climate \\nextremes, economic slowdowns and downturns, \\nand growing inequality – often occurring in \\ncombination, is challenging our efforts to achieve \\nthe SDGs. There is no question these threats will \\ncontinue, requiring that we remain steadfast to \\nbuild resilience against them. However, there \\nare still important megatrends that must be \\nfully understood when devising policies to meet \\nthe SDG 2 targets. \\nOne such megatrend, and the focus of this year’s \\nreport, is urbanization. As urbanization increases, \\nrural and urban areas are becoming more \\nintertwined, and the spatial distinction between \\nthem is becoming more fluid. The changing \\npattern of population agglomerations across \\nthis rural–urban continuum is driving changes \\nthroughout agrifood systems, creating both \\nchallenges and opportunities to ensure everyone \\nhas access to affordable healthy diets. \\nAfter presenting the latest updates of the food \\nsecurity and nutrition situation around the world, \\nthe report then examines the drivers, patterns and \\ndynamics of urbanization through a rural–urban \\ncontinuum lens and presents new analysis on \\nhow urbanization is changing food supply and \\ndemand across the rural–urban continuum. \\nComplementing this, further analyses for \\nselected countries explore differences in the cost \\nand affordability of a healthy diet, and in food \\ninsecurity and different forms of malnutrition \\nacross the rural–urban continuum. \\nBuilding on these insights, the report identifies \\npolicies, investments and new technologies to \\naddress the challenges, and capitalize on the \\nopportunities, that urbanization brings for \\nensuring access to affordable healthy diets for \\neveryone, across the rural–urban continuum.\\nFOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION \\nAROUND THE WORLD\\nFood security indicators – latest \\nupdates and progress towards ending \\nhunger and ensuring food security\\nThe global assessment of the state of food \\nsecurity and nutrition in 2022 is a snapshot of the \\nworld still recovering from a global pandemic \\nand now grappling with the consequences of \\nthe war in Ukraine, which has rattled food and \\nenergy markets.

Stunting and other \\nforms of undernutrition early in life may \\nalso predispose children to being overweight \\nand developing non-communicable diseases \\n(NCDs) later in life.

Affected children are dangerously \\nthin, with weakened immunity and a higher \\nrisk of mortality. The prevalence of wasting \\namong children under five years of age declined \\nfrom 8.7\\xa0percent in 2000 to 6.8\\xa0percent in \\n2022. The estimated number of children with \\nwasting declined from 54.1\\xa0million in 2000 to \\n45.0\\xa0million in 2022. \\nChildren who are overweight or obese face both \\nimmediate and potentially long-term health \\nimpacts, including a higher risk of NCDs later in \\nlife. Child overweight has been on the rise in many \\ncountries, hastened by increasingly inadequate \\nlevels of physical activity and increased access to \\nhighly processed foods. Globally, the prevalence \\nof overweight among children under five years \\nof age showed a non-significant increase from \\n5.3\\xa0percent (33.0\\xa0million) in 2000 to 5.6\\xa0percent \\n(37 .0\\xa0million) in 2022. \\nThe latest estimate for low birthweight revealed \\nthat 14.7\\xa0percent of newborns (19.8\\xa0million) were \\nborn with low birthweight (less than 2\\xa0500\\xa0g) \\nin 2020, a non-significant decline from the \\n16.6 percent (22.1\\xa0million) in 2000. Infants born \\nweighing less than 2\\xa0500\\xa0g are approximately \\n20\\xa0times more likely to die than those with \\nadequate birthweight, and those who survive face \\nlong-term development and health consequences. \\nOptimal breastfeeding practices, including \\nexclusive breastfeeding for the first six months \\nof life, are critical for child survival and the \\npromotion of health and cognitive development. \\nGlobally, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding \\namong infants under six months of age has \\nrisen from 37 .0 percent (24.3 million) in 2012 to \\n47 .7 percent (31.2 million) in 2021.

This process \\nis fast-changing, context specific and driven by \\nintertwined factors. \\nMany parts of the world have rapidly urbanized, \\nwith the urban share of the world’s population \\nrising from 30\\xa0percent in 1950 to 57\\xa0percent in \\n2021. It is projected to reach 68 percent by 2050. \\nIn most regions, this has been largely driven \\nby structural transformation, which entails \\nan economic transformation from mainly \\nagriculture to a more diversified national \\neconomy, in the process attracting rural people \\nto urban areas. \\nWhile urbanization often goes hand in hand with \\neconomic growth and structural transformation, \\nthis does not hold for all countries and regions. \\nUrbanization without economic growth can be \\nlinked to poor rural living conditions, including \\npoverty, lack of employment or underemployment, \\nlack of infrastructure, lack of access to services, \\nand food insecurity.\\nAnother factor that may contribute to urbanization \\nis climate change and/or environmental \\ndegradation, which can affect rural-to-urban \\nmigration movements. Populations that depend \\non natural resources for their livelihoods can be \\ncompelled to migrate to urban areas in search of \\nwork, due to the effects of climate change and \\nbiodiversity loss. There is also an increasing \\noccurrence of forced displacement from rural \\nareas to urban areas, often as a result of disasters \\nand/or conflict.\\nWith urban expansion and improving road and \\ncommunication infrastructure across larger parts \\nof rural areas, the distinction between rural \\nand urban areas is increasingly blurred. A large \\nshare of the new urban dwellers are expected to \\nlive in peri-urban areas, as well as in small cities \\nand interconnected towns. Increasingly, rural \\nand urban areas are less separate spaces in their \\nown right, but rather two ends of a spectrum, \\nconnected via numerous linkages across a \\nrural–urban continuum. \\nAlmost half of the global population (47\\xa0percent) \\nlive in peri-urban areas (less than 1 hour to large, \\nintermediate and small cities or towns) and rural \\nareas (1 to 2 hours or more to an urban centre). \\nGiven the increasing connectivity of peri-urban \\nand rural areas and the convergence of high food \\npurchases in both, it is clear that peri-urban and \\nrural markets are significant drivers of agrifood \\nsystems transformation. \\nThe degree of connectivity between rural and \\nurban areas shapes agrifood systems, and thus the \\navailability of affordable healthy diets, and the \\nlivelihoods of urban and rural primary producers, \\nprocessors and traders.

Increases in \\nfood demand in urban areas are occurring \\nsimultaneously with increases in the amount \\nof food that agrifood systems have to produce, \\nprocess and distribute, which, together with \\nchanges in consumer behaviour, are being \\nseen across the rural–urban continuum. These \\nchanges may also lead to disparities across the \\nrural–urban continuum, with both positive \\nand negative effects on the availability and \\naffordability of healthy diets, and in turn, on \\nfood security and nutrition outcomes. \\nOne of the most important pathways through \\nwhich urbanization is driving changes in agrifood \\nsystems is through a shift in consumer behaviour \\nand diets . Higher average incomes, combined \\nwith changing lifestyles and employment, are \\ndriving a diet transition characterized by changes \\nin the types and quantities of food consumed, \\nwith diets shifting beyond traditional grains \\ninto dairy, fish, meat, vegetables and fruits. \\nThere is a diffusion of food purchases in rural \\nareas, more so than is commonly understood. \\nThe diet in these areas has shifted from \\nmainly home-produced foods to increasingly \\nmarket-purchased products.\\nHowever, urbanization has also contributed \\nto the spread and consumption of processed \\nand highly processed foods, which are \\nincreasingly cheaper and more readily available \\nand marketed. Changes in the lifestyles and \\nemployment profiles of both women and men, \\nas well as increasing commuting times, are \\nresulting in greater demand for convenience, \\npre-prepared and fast foods. The\\xa0diet transition \\nis also occurring in rural areas, though lagged \\nand to a lesser extent compared to urban and \\nperi-urban areas. \\nUrbanization is also leading to changes in \\nmidstream and downstream food supply \\nchains , which have become longer, more formal \\nand more complex following rising consumer \\ndemand and increased regulation of agrifood \\nsystems. Importantly, growing midstream \\nand downstream activities provide important \\noff-farm employment opportunities, which can \\nprovide steady and liveable incomes, increasing \\nthe affordability of healthy diets.\\nSupply-side factors, coupled with an increase \\nin demand for readily available foods, have \\ncontributed to a substantial expansion of \\nsupermarkets and hypermarkets that use modern \\nfood technology. While these markets can be \\nlinked to increased access to nutritious foods \\n– through reduced waste, enhanced sanitation \\nand reduced adverse effects of seasonality, for \\nexample – they have also been associated with \\nincreased supply of energy-dense and highly \\nprocessed foods.\\nUrbanization, in particular, by increasing the \\nconnectivity of rural and urban areas, also \\naffects agrifood systems through changes in \\nagricultural production . While urbanization \\nis often associated with a diversification of \\ndiets, the availability of vegetables and fruits, \\nin particular, is insufficient to meet the daily \\ndietary requirements in almost every region of \\nthe world.\\nAs urban areas become better connected to rural \\nareas, rural producers may also have better access \\nto agricultural inputs and services, allowing for \\nimproved productivity that typically increases \\nincome levels.

These factors together \\nwith many supply-side considerations, including \\nfood pricing, marketing and promotion, among \\nothers, in turn are changing agrifood systems, so \\nthere is a reinforcing compounding effect on the \\nfood produced, supplied and consumed. \\nMost notably, rapid urbanization is leading \\nto rising and changing food demand, and \\nshifts in patterns of food supply – especially \\nin sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, the \\ntwo regions exhibiting the highest urbanization \\nrates. Projections of overall food expenditure \\nestimate an approximate 2.5-fold increase in \\nsub-Saharan Africa and a 1.7-fold increase in \\nSouthern Asia by 2050.\\nAnalysis of food demand, defined as household \\nfood consumption (at market value), across the \\nrural–urban continuum in selected countries \\nwas conducted and revealed interesting \\npatterns. This was made possible by applying \\nthe newly available geospatial Urban Rural \\nCatchment Areas (URCA) dataset combined \\nwith georeferenced data from nationally \\nrepresentative Living Standards Measurement \\nStudy (LSMS) surveys. For reasons of data \\navailability, the surveys used covered the period \\n2018/19 for Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, \\nEthiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, the Niger, Nigeria, \\nSenegal and Togo, and 2019/20 for Malawi.\\nGiven it is expected that diets become \\nmore diversified with higher levels of food \\nconsumption, income and employment, the \\n11 countries were classified into two groups \\naccording to their food budget (i.e. the market \\nvalue of their total food consumption per \\ncapita per day): high-food-budget countries \\n(average 2.3\\xa0PPP dollars per capita per day) and \\nlow-food-budget countries (average 1.6\\xa0PPP \\ndollars per capita per day).\\nNew empirical evidence from this analysis, \\nchallenges traditional thinking and reveals \\nimportant food consumption patterns, including \\ndietary convergence across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum.

The higher cost of animal \\nsource foods, compared to the other food groups, \\ndrives up the cost of a healthy diet across the \\nrural–urban continuum, especially in urban and \\nremote rural areas. \\nThe cost of a healthy diet exceeds average \\nfood expenditure for low- and middle-income \\nhouseholds in both high- and low-food-budget \\ncountries in the 11\\xa0countries analysed. \\nLow-income households living in peri-urban and \\nrural areas are especially disadvantaged, as they \\nwould need to more than double their current \\nexpenditure on food to secure a healthy diet. \\nAlthough the cost of a healthy diet in peri-urban \\nareas is lower than in urban areas, this does not \\ntranslate into a more affordable healthy diet in \\nthe former. On average, the percentage of the \\npopulation unable to afford a healthy diet in \\nperi-urban areas is 1.5\\xa0times higher than in urban \\ncentres and similar to rural areas. \\nAn analysis of food insecurity based on the \\nFIES for 9 of the 11\\xa0African countries shows that \\nin many of these countries, the prevalence of \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity in urban and \\nperi-urban areas is similar to that in rural areas, \\nand in some cases, slightly higher, indicating that \\nfood insecurity is not exclusively a rural problem.\\nThe prevalence of malnutrition across the ten \\nURCA categories was only estimated for 3 of \\nthe 11\\xa0countries, due to data limitations. In the \\nthree countries (Benin, Nigeria and Senegal), \\ngenerally the prevalence of stunting in children \\nunder five years of age gradually increases as \\ncities become smaller and as one moves away \\nfrom urban centres. \\nThe prevalence of wasting in children under \\nfive years of age is lower than that of stunting \\nin all three countries and exhibits less evident \\ntrends across the rural–urban continuum. \\nNevertheless, there are hints of increased \\nwasting in some peri-urban and rural areas in \\nNigeria and Senegal.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s \\nurban population is projected to almost quadruple \\nin size by 2050, reaching 1.3\\xa0billion, compared \\nwith 306\\xa0million in 2010. 4 At the same time, the \\nrural population is projected to increase less \\nrapidly but still profoundly, from 540\\xa0million in \\n2010 to 909\\xa0million in 2050. In Asia, the urban \\npopulation is projected to increase by 83\\xa0percent, \\nfrom 1.9\\xa0billion to 3.5\\xa0billion, while the rural \\npopulation is projected to decline by 540\\xa0million, \\nfrom 2.3\\xa0billion\\xa0to 1.8\\xa0billion. But in Southern \\nAsia, the urban population is projected to more \\nthan double, increasing by 120\\xa0percent, from \\n555\\xa0million to 1.3\\xa0billion. \\nUrbanization arises from a combination of \\nrural push factors (e.g.\\xa0poverty, inequitable \\nland distribution, environmental degradation, \\nand forced displacement due to disasters or \\nconflict) and urban pull factors (e.g.\\xa0urban \\nemployment, higher wages, better social services \\nand educational opportunities), which vary \\ndepending on the country and specific context. \\nThis leads to increased food supply and demand, \\ndirect and indirect land-use change, and more \\ncomplex agrifood market linkages among \\nproducers, midstream supply chain processors \\nand distributors, and consumers. 5 While living in \\nurban areas has often been associated with higher \\nstandards of living overall, these areas may also \\nhave pockets of abject poverty compared to rural \\nareas, and their services are often stretched to \\nthe limit. This can result in lack of access to \\naffordable healthy diets, as well as increases in \\npoverty and food insecurity and multiple forms \\nof malnutrition. \\nAcross the entire rural–urban continuum, the \\nmajority of food consumed is purchased from \\nmarkets. Hence, the type of diet that households \\nconsume is determined by cost and affordability, \\nOne such megatrend, and the thematic focus of \\nthis year’s report, is urbanization. As urbanization \\nincreases, rural and urban areas are becoming \\nmore intertwined, and the spatial distinction \\nbetween them is becoming more fluid. Population \\ngrowth in small and medium-sized cities \\nand rural towns now increasingly “bridges” \\nthe space between the rural hinterland and \\nlarge metropolises. 1, 2  The changing pattern \\nof population agglomerations across this \\nrural–urban continuum is driving changes \\nthroughout agrifood systems, creating both \\nchallenges and opportunities to ensure everyone \\nhas access to affordable healthy diets. Overcoming \\nthe challenges and leveraging the opportunities \\nwill require actions and policy interventions \\nthat are informed by a clear understanding of \\nhow the rural–urban continuum and agrifood \\nsystems interact.\\nWhile rates of urbanization vary across countries, \\nwith the rate of any given country often linked \\nto its stage of structural transformation, \\nurbanization overall is accelerating. By 2050, \\nalmost seven in ten people are projected to \\nlive in cities; but even today this proportion is \\nalready approximately 56\\xa0percent. a In low- and \\nmiddle-income countries, the urban population \\nis growing more than three times faster than the \\nrural population (3.08\\xa0percent compared with \\n0.89\\xa0percent annually, from 2015 to 2020). 3  \\nBy 2030, the urban population in these countries \\nis projected to exceed 4\\xa0billion; that is, it will \\nhave more than doubled in size since the year \\n2000. In contrast, the rural population of low- \\nand middle-income countries is projected \\nto increase much less, to at least 3\\xa0billion by \\n2050 – only slightly higher than the 2.95\\xa0billion \\nfigure of 2000. While rural populations are still \\nincreasing rapidly in some regions such as the \\nAfrican drylands, in most other regions rural \\npopulations are declining, including in Latin \\nAmerica and Europe.\\na The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs \\n(UN\\xa0DESA) does not apply its own definition of “urban” population, but \\ninstead follows the definition used in each country. The definitions are \\ngenerally those used by national statistical offices in carrying out the \\nlatest available census. Each country applies its own population criteria \\nfor classifying cities as urban. 3\\n| 2 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 32, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nwhich in turn depend on the structure of agrifood \\nsystems, including food supply and value-added \\nchains.

To better understand \\nthis, Chapter\\xa04 presents new analysis precisely \\non how urbanization is changing food demand, \\nutilizing a unique Urban Rural Catchment \\nAreas (URCA) global dataset combined with \\ngeoreferenced household survey data. This is \\nfollowed by additional analysis for selected \\ncountries exploring differences in the cost and \\naffordability of a healthy diet, and in food \\ninsecurity and different forms of malnutrition \\nacross the rural–urban continuum.\\nFinally, building on the insights from the \\nprevious chapters, Chapter \\xa05 identifies the \\npolicies, new technologies, and associated \\ninvestments that can be adapted to address the \\nchallenges – and capitalize on the opportunities\\xa0– \\nthat urbanization brings for ensuring access to \\naffordable healthy diets for everyone, across the \\nrural–urban continuum. The chapter describes \\nthe governance mechanisms and institutions \\nthat are needed to achieve a more coherent and \\nintegrated approach for implementing these \\npolicies and solutions. \\nSuch timely evidence and recommendations are \\nrelevant to the New Urban Agenda, endorsed \\nby the United Nations General Assembly in \\n2016, as well as other global processes such as \\nthe United Nations Food Systems Summit and \\nthe establishment of the Urban Food Systems \\nCoalition in 2021.

The negative impacts on food \\nsecurity of the war in Ukraine (and other conflicts), \\nsoaring food prices and extreme weather events were \\nfelt more strongly in some places than in others. \\nConsistent with this, the most recent edition of the \\nGlobal Report on Food Crises (GRFC) 2 reinforces \\nthese conclusions.\\nThe GRFC and this report are both multipartnership \\nefforts that provide international assessments of food \\nsecurity; however, their objectives and geographical \\nscope are distinct, and they rely on different data and \\nmethodologies. On the one hand, this report has the \\nbroad objective of monitoring chronic food insecurity \\nin the entire world, on a regular basis, by reporting \\non SDG Indicators\\xa02.1.1 and\\xa02.1.2. Chronic food \\ninsecurity is defined as a structural, long-term situation \\nof food deprivation. The PoU, for example, measures \\nhunger (chronic undernourishment) defined as the \\nlong-term or persistent inability to meet minimum \\ndietary energy requirements and, within a country, \\nit is estimated to be representative of the whole \\npopulation. The GRFC, on the other hand, focuses \\nmore narrowly on acute food insecurity in countries \\nexperiencing food crises for the purpose of guiding \\nimmediate humanitarian response. Acute food \\ninsecurity refers to a short-term (possibly temporary) \\ninability to meet dietary energy requirements, related \\nto sporadic crises that may sometimes be protracted \\nand are of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods. \\nAssessments of food insecurity prioritize the use of \\nthe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification/\\nCadre Harmonisé (IPC/CH), applied in a set of \\ncountries that are susceptible to food crisis situations \\nand, therefore, potentially in need of humanitarian \\nassistance.* These assessments are not statistical \\nmeasurements, but rather the result of a process \\nof convergence of evidence reached by a country \\nteam of analysts, based on the most recent available \\ninformation from various sources. Within a country, \\nrough estimates of the number of people facing crisis \\nlevels of acute food insecurity are presented that refer \\nto the specific populations covered by the analysis, \\nand not necessarily to the whole population at the \\nnational level.\\nBecause of these conceptual and measurement \\ndifferences, a direct comparison of figures from \\nboth reports is not possible. However, acute and \\nchronic food insecurity are not unrelated phenomena. \\nRepeated shocks and persistent crises can provoke \\nsituations of chronic food insecurity. Because of this, \\none expects some alignment, at least in trends, of the \\nresults of the two reports. \\nHaving this in mind, the 2023 GRFC 2 points to an \\nincrease of around 37\\xa0million people facing acute food \\ninsecurity (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) from 2021 to \\n2022 in the same 48 countries analysed in both years.** \\nThat is equivalent to an increase in the prevalence of \\nacute food insecurity from 21.8\\xa0percent to 22.5\\xa0percent \\nof the analysed population. An analysis of hunger (PoU) \\nrestricted to the same group of 48 countries analysed \\nby the GRFC shows an increase of 14\\xa0million in the \\nnumber of people facing chronic undernourishment, \\nequivalent to an increase in the PoU from 20.8 percent \\nto 21.3 percent of the combined populations of those \\n48 countries (Figure\\xa0A). This reveals convergence in the \\nassessments of the trends and points to the existence \\nof persistent food crises in many parts of the world, \\nreinforcing the need to better understand the nexus \\nbetween acute and chronic food insecurity, particularly \\nin food crisis countries.\\nNOTES: * When recent IPC/CH is not available, alternative sources are used such as the Consolidated Approach for Reporting Indicators of Food Security \\nor the Famine Early Warning Systems Network.

At the \\nsame time, export revenues have been declining \\nin key sectors, including tourism, resulting \\nin reduced disposable income and increased \\nfood insecurit y. 14 On the contrary, the observed \\ndecline in hunger in 2022 in South America , a \\nnet exporter of food and agricultural products, \\nstemmed largely from positive development in \\nlabour markets, which counteracted the surge \\nin inflation, as well as from social protection \\npolicies. 14 Additionally, some countries in the \\nregion have benefited from the surge in oil and \\ngas prices that boosted export revenues. This has \\ntranslated into improved public budget resources \\n(which could be used to finance social protection \\nprogrammes) and investment in agriculture and \\nfood distribution systems.\\nAt the country level, these countervailing forces \\nhave played out in different ways with unequal \\nimpacts on trends in hunger. A comparison \\nacross country income groups of changes in \\nthe PoU between 2019 and 2022 shows that \\nLICs are still struggling the most to recover. \\nGlobally, 58\\xa0percent of countries had a PoU in \\n2022 that was still above pre-pandemic levels. \\nHowever, the percentage is much higher in LICs; \\n77\\xa0percent of LICs have not returned to PoU \\nlevels observed in 2019, in contrast to 47\\xa0percent \\nof UMICs ( Figure 4).\\nThe halt in the rise in global hunger observed in \\n2022 is also consistent with nowcasts of poverty \\navailable for 2022. 10 Projections for 2022 are that, \\ndespite an expected reduction in poverty between \\n2021 and 2022, the pace of reduction will further \\nstall given the downward revised prospects of \\nglobal growth in 2022 and higher prices of food, \\nagricultural inputs and energy. It is estimated \\nthat the number of people in extreme poverty will \\nhave decreased by 5\\xa0million from 2021 to 2022, \\nbased on a scenario that takes into consideration \\nthe relatively greater impact of high food \\ninflation among the poor.\\nTowards ending hunger (SDG Target\\xa02.1): \\nprojections to 2030 \\nAs in previous editions of the report, an \\nexercise was conducted to project how many \\npeople may be facing hunger in 2030 based on \\nwhat can be inferred from available forecasts \\nof fundamental demographic and economic \\nvariables. The projections were obtained by \\nseparately projecting each of the parameters \\nthat inform the model used to estimate the PoU \\n(see\\xa0 Annex\\xa02, Section\\xa0B). \\nTrajectories are presented under three scenarios: \\n“current prospects” , which aims to capture \\ncurrent projections of the PoU in 2030 based on \\nthe world economic prospects presented in the \\nApril 2023 edition of the International Monetary \\nFund World Economic Outlook database; 3 \\n“projections before COVID-19” , calibrated to \\nreflect the situation of the world economy \\nbefore the pandemic, as described by the World \\nEconomic Outlook  published in October 2019; 15 \\nand “projections before the war in Ukraine” , \\nwhich does the same but considering the October \\n2021 edition of the same publication 16 before the \\noutbreak of the war. \\nThe current scenario shows that almost \\n600\\xa0million people will be chronically \\nundernourished in 2030, pointing to the \\nimmense challenge of achieving the SDG \\ntarget to eradicate hunger ( Figure\\xa05 ). This is \\nabout 119\\xa0million more undernourished people \\nthan in the scenario in which neither the \\npandemic nor the war in Ukraine had occurred \\n(the “projections before COVID-19” scenario) \\nand around 23\\xa0million more than in the \\nscenario where the war had not happened (the \\n“projections before the war in Ukraine” scenario). \\nThe latter provides an indication of the additional \\nsetback the war may have caused in the global \\nfight against\\xa0hunger. \\nFigure 5  also  shows how the situation is currently \\nexpected to evolve in Asia, Africa, and Latin \\nAmerica and the Caribbean.

SDG Indicator\\xa02.1.2 – the \\nprevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity \\nin the population, based on the FIES – tracks \\nprogress towards this ambitious goal.\\nNew estimates of the prevalence of food \\ninsecurity based on the FIES confirm that for \\n2022 no progress was made on food insecurity \\nat the global level. Following a sharp increase \\nfrom 2019 to 2020, the global prevalence of \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity remained \\nunchanged for the second year in a row, far \\nabove pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels ( Figure 6  \\nand Table 3). In 2022, an estimated 29.6\\xa0percent of \\nthe global population – 2.4\\xa0billion people – were \\nmoderately or severely food insecure, meaning \\nthey did not have access to adequate food ( Table\\xa03 \\nand Table\\xa04). This is still 391\\xa0million more people \\nthan in 2019, before the pandemic, and 745\\xa0million \\nmore compared to 2015 when the 2030 Sustainable \\nDevelopment Agenda was launched. \\nMore than one-third (38\\xa0percent) of people \\nfacing moderate or severe food insecurity in the \\nworld in 2022 – over 900\\xa0million – were severely \\nfood insecure, indicating that they had run out \\nof food at times during the year and, at worst, \\ngone an entire day or more without eating. The \\nprevalence of severe food insecurity at the global \\nlevel showed a marginal decline from 11.7\\xa0percent \\nin 2021 to 11.3\\xa0percent in 2022, the equivalent of \\n27\\xa0million fewer people ( Figure 6, Table\\xa03 and Table\\xa04). \\nWhile it is encouraging that the upward trend in \\nsevere food insecurity of the past six years has not \\ncontinued, the global prevalence is still far above \\npre-pandemic levels – equivalent to 180\\xa0million \\nmore people compared to 2019 ( Table\\xa03 and\\xa0 Table\\xa04). \\nAt the global level, the slight decrease in severe \\nfood insecurity, and unchanged prevalence of \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity, suggest that \\nthe gravity of the food insecurity situation of \\nsome people may have transitioned from severe to \\nmoderate from 2021 to 2022. \\nAs expected, the global trends in the prevalence \\nof severe food insecurity are similar to the \\ntrends for the PoU ( Table 1). This is because people \\nexperiencing severe food insecurity are unlikely \\nto be able to acquire enough food to continuously \\nfulfil their dietary energy requirements, and \\nthus may become chronically undernourished. \\nBoth indicators provide evidence regarding \\nthe proportion of the population facing severe \\nconstraints on food access, albeit based on very \\ndifferent methodologies and sources of data \\n(see Annex\\xa01B). \\nDespite the lack of change in the prevalence \\nof food insecurity at the global level, there \\nwere divergent trends at the regional level. \\nImprovements in some regions were offset \\nby worsening situations in others ( Figure 6, \\nTable\\xa03 and Table\\xa04).\\nThe prevalence of moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity in Africa  increased by one percentage \\npoint in one year to 60.9\\xa0percent in 2022.  \\nThe increase is much smaller compared to the \\nprevious year, when it rose by 4\\xa0percentage points. \\nFrom 2021 to 2022, the prevalence of moderate \\nor severe food insecurity rose in Eastern Africa, \\nMiddle Africa and Southern Africa by 2.4, 3.0 and \\n1.2\\xa0percentage points, respectively. The prevalence \\nin 2022 ranged from 25.9\\xa0percent in Southern \\nAfrica to 78.4\\xa0percent in Middle Africa. The \\nincrease in moderate or severe food insecurity \\nin Africa from 2021 to 2022 is mostly due to \\nmore people facing moderate food insecurity, as \\nthe rise in severe food insecurity in the region \\nwas marginal. Nevertheless, nearly one in four \\npeople in Africa (24.0\\xa0percent) was facing severe \\nfood insecurity in 2022. The prevalence of severe \\nfood insecurity rose in Northern Africa, Middle \\nAfrica, Southern Africa and Western Africa by \\n0.8, 1.3, 1.5 and 0.3\\xa0percentage points, respectively \\n– the equivalent of 2.4\\xa0million more people in \\nNorthern Africa, 4.8\\xa0million more in Middle \\n| 18 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 48, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nAfrica, 1.1\\xa0million more in Southern Africa, and \\n3.6\\xa0million more in Western Africa facing severe \\nfood insecurity in 2022 compared to 2021. \\nA non-significant decrease in food insecurity \\nwas registered in Asia , where 24.2\\xa0percent of the \\npopulation was facing moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity in 2022 compared with 24.5\\xa0percent \\nin 2021.

Food insecurity is more prevalent \\namong adult women than men in every region of \\nthe world. The gender gap in food insecurity at the \\nglobal level widened considerably in 2020 and 2021 \\nin the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as women \\nwere more affected by job and income losses and \\nbore a larger responsibility for additional, unpaid \\ncaregiving duties. 18,\\xa019  Women living in rural areas \\nwere even more likely to be food insecure, 20 as job \\nand income losses were much higher for women \\nthan for men particularly in agrifood systems. 21 \\nIn 2021, the gender gap reached 3.8\\xa0percentage \\npoints, with 28.6\\xa0percent of women in the world \\nbeing moderately or severely food insecure \\ncompared with 24.8\\xa0percent of men ( Figure 9). \\nFor 2022, the food insecurity gap between men and \\nwomen appears to have narrowed considerably \\nat the global level, which may partially reflect \\na return of women to economic activities as \\npandemic-related restrictions were eased, and a \\nweakening of the disproportionate impacts of the \\npandemic on women’s food insecurity.

This increase \\nis due to the overall rise in inflation in 2020 and 2021, \\ndriven in part by the persisting effects of the pandemic. \\nè Worldwide in 2021, the average cost of a healthy \\ndiet was 3.66\\xa0PPP dollars per person per day. The\\xa0cost \\nwas higher in Latin America and the Caribbean \\n(4.08\\xa0PPP dollars) compared to Asia (3.90\\xa0PPP dollars), \\nAfrica (3.57\\xa0PPP dollars), Northern America and Europe \\n(3.22\\xa0PPP dollars), and Oceania (3.20\\xa0PPP dollars).\\nè In Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the \\nCaribbean, the cost of a healthy diet increased by \\nmore than 5\\xa0percent from 2020 to 2021, negatively \\naffecting all subregions except for Northern Africa, \\nwhere the cost fell by 2.8\\xa0percent. In the same period, \\nthe cost of a healthy diet rose in Oceania (5.2\\xa0percent) \\nand in Northern America and Europe (marginally, \\nby 0.6\\xa0percent). The surge hit lower-middle-income \\ncountries more than high-income countries. \\nè More than 3.1\\xa0billion people in the world –  \\nor 42\\xa0percent – were unable to afford a healthy diet in \\n2021, representing an increase of 134\\xa0million people \\ncompared to 2019, before the pandemic.

A healthy diet is composed of a variety \\nof nutritious and safe foods that provide dietary \\nenergy and nutrients in the amounts needed for \\na healthy and active life. A healthy diet is based \\non a wide range of unprocessed or minimally \\nprocessed foods, balanced across food groups, \\nwhile it restricts the consumption of highly \\nprocessed foods and drink products; it includes \\nwholegrains, legumes, nuts, an abundance and \\nvariety of fruits and vegetables, and can include \\nmoderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and \\nfish, and small amounts of red meat. 22,\\xa023  Eating a \\nhealthy diet throughout the life cycle is critical for \\npreventing all forms of malnutrition, including \\nchild stunting and wasting, micronutrient \\ndeficiencies and overweight or obesity. It also \\nhelps reduce the risk of non-communicable \\ndiseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, \\ndiabetes and certain types of cancer. 24 \\nFAO, with support from the World Bank Data \\nGroup, systematically monitors the cost and \\naffordability of a healthy diet (CoAHD) indicators \\nand recently began to disseminate the updated \\nseries on the FAOSTAT database. 25 These \\nindicators provide evidence regarding people’s \\neconomic access to the lowest-cost healthy diet \\nin a given country, using locally available foods \\nto meet nutritional requirements. In this year’s \\nreport, the CoAHD indicators are updated to \\n2021. Lack of updated income distribution at the \\ncountry level and of detailed food prices and \\npurchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factors \\nmakes it impossible to update these estimates for \\n2022. See Annex\\xa02, Section\\xa0D for details on the \\nmethodology and important updates. \\nThis year, affordability indicators reflect not \\nonly price shocks but also income shocks \\ninduced by the pandemic, better capturing \\nthe global situation in 2020 and 2021. This was \\npossible because income distributions – derived \\nfrom the Poverty and Inequality Platform to \\nestimate affordability – have now been updated \\nto include the years 2020 and 2021 for all \\ncountries (see Annex\\xa02, Section\\xa0D ).i Following \\nthe recent release of new PPPs for 2017 , the \\nWorld Bank adopted the latest conversion \\nfactors to present its monetary indicators in 2017 \\nPPP terms, including income distributions. 26 \\nConsequently, the indicators of affordability are \\nexpressed in 2017 PPP rather than 2011 PPP , as in \\nprevious years (see Annex\\xa02, Section\\xa0D ). \\nThe cost and affordability of a healthy \\ndiet in 2021\\nThe revised analysis presented in this year’s \\nreport – which accounts for updated income \\ndistributions in 2020 and 2021 – shows that \\nalmost 3.2\\xa0billion people worldwide could \\nnot afford a healthy diet in 2020, with a slight \\nimprovement in 2021 (a decrease of 52 million \\npeople). Food prices continued to climb \\nthroughout 2021, pushing up the average cost of \\na healthy diet globally. However, a rebound in \\neconomic growth in many countries, particularly \\nin Asia, may have translated into larger fiscal \\nspace for stimulus packages, social transfers \\nand improved labour markets. 27,\\xa028  These efforts \\nhelped to counter the effects of high food \\ninflation, thereby reducing the number of people \\nunable to afford a healthy diet at the global level, \\nlargely driven by Asia. \\nTable 5 presents the CoAHD indicators at the \\nglobal and regional levels, and by country \\nincome group, for 2019, 2020 and 2021. Estimated \\nranges of affordability indicators are presented \\nin Table\\xa0A3.2  for 2021, where lower and upper \\nbounds reflect different assumptions about the \\nshare of income reserved for food. Country-level \\ni In last year’s report, affordability in 2020 was obtained by applying \\nthe cost of a healthy diet in 2020 to income distributions in 2019, hence \\naccounting for price shocks induced by the pandemic, but not for \\nincome shocks.\\n| 26 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 56, 'page_label': '27'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nCost of a healthy diet  \\n(PPP dollars per person per day)\\nProportion of the \\npopulation unable to \\nafford a healthy diet (%)\\nNumber of people unable  \\nto afford a healthy diet  \\n(millions)\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2019–2020 \\nchange (%)\\n2020–2021 \\nchange (%)\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2019–2020 \\nchange \\n(millions)\\n2020–2021 \\nchange \\n(millions)\\nWORLD 3.43 3.51 3.66 2.3 4.3 41.2 43.3 42.2 3 005.5 3 191.9 3 139.5 186.4 -52.4\\nAFRICA 3.31 3.38 3.57 2.2 5.6 77.4 77.9 77.5 989.4 1 020.7 1 040.5 31.3 19.8\\nNorthern Africa 3.60 3.57 3.47 -0.6 -2.8 54.7 54.0 51.7 131.3 131.9 128.5 0.6 -3.4\\nSub-Saharan Africa 3.28 3.36 3.58 2.6 6.6 82.6 83.3 83.4 858.1 888.8 912.1 30.7 23.3\\nEastern Africa 3.01 3.09 3.29 2.7 6.7 84.2 84.7 84.6 341.3 352.7 361.9 11.4 9.2\\nMiddle Africa 3.30 3.37 3.55 2.2 5.3 82.1 82.2 81.9 145.7 150.5 154.5 4.8 4.0\\nSouthern Africa 3.71 3.84 4.06 3.4 5.8 65.4 67.4 67.0 43.4 45.3 45.6 1.9 0.3\\nWestern Africa 3.37 3.45 3.71 2.5 7.6 84.1 85.1 85.4 327.6 340.3 350.1 12.7 9.8\\nASIA 3.57 3.70 3.90 3.7 5.2 43.2 46.4 44.2 1 877.4 2 031.4 1 949.9 154.0 -81.5\\nCentral Asia 2.91 3.10 3.32 6.7 7.2 21.3 24.6 24.4 7.3 8.6 8.7 1.3 0.1\\nEastern Asia 4.45 4.67 4.87 5.1 4.1 11.2 14.5 10.0 177.8 230.9 159.4 53.1 -71.5\\nSouth-eastern Asia 3.86 3.99 4.19 3.6 4.8 52.3 54.0 54.9 335.1 349.0 357.4 13.9 8.4\\nSouthern Asia 3.66 3.82 4.08 4.2 6.9 70.2 73.8 72.2 1 340.6 1 425.9 1 408.5 85.3 -17.4\\nWestern Asia 3.15 3.22 3.36 2.2 4.5 9.7 9.7 9.0 16.7 17.0 15.9 0.3 -1.1\\nLATIN AMERICA AND \\nTHE CARIBBEAN 3.78 3.88 4.08 2.7 5.3 20.8 20.9 22.7 120.0 121.9 133.4 1.9 11.5\\nCaribbean 4.06 4.20 4.41 3.3 5.0 51.6 55.2 57.0 13.7 14.8 15.4 1.1 0.6\\nLatin America 3.49 3.55 3.75 1.9 5.6 19.3 19.3 21.1 106.3 107.1 118.0 0.8 10.9\\nCentral America 3.45 3.48 3.62 0.8 4.1 23.6 25.4 22.2 35.7 38.7 34.2 3.0 -4.5\\nSouth America 3.50 3.59 3.82 2.4 6.4 17.7 17.0 20.6 70.6 68.4 83.8 -2.2 15.4\\nOCEANIA 2.96 3.04 3.20 2.8 5.2 2.6 2.7 2.9 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.0 0.1\\nNORTHERN \\nAMERICA AND \\nEUROPE\\n3.19 3.20 3.22 0.6 0.6 1.7 1.6 1.4 18.1 17.2 14.9 -0.9 -2.3\\nCOUNTRY INCOME GROUP\\nLow-income \\ncountries 3.14 3.22 3.37 2.5 4.7 86.7 86.9 86.1 456.8 471.0 480.0 14.2 9.0\\nLower-middle-income \\ncountries 3.55 3.65 3.88 2.9 6.2 68.3 71.0 70.2 2 180.7 2 296.8 2 299.6 116.1 2.8\\nUpper-middle-income \\ncountries 3.65 3.72 3.91 2.0 5.1 14.4 16.6 14.1 350.5 406.4 345.5 55.9 -60.9\\nHigh-income \\ncountries 3.29 3.36 3.43 2.1 2.1 1.5 1.5 1.3 17.4 17.6 14.3 0.2 -3.3\\nNOTES: The cost of a healthy diet is expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars per person per day.

In many countries, the increase in \\nthe cost of a healthy diet occurred in combination \\nwith a decline in disposable income following the \\npersisting effects of the pandemic.

These analyses examine the \\ndistribution of the burden based on the latest \\nclassification of a country’s income group.\\nThe distributions of the global burden for five \\nnutrition indicators by country income group \\nare presented in Figure\\xa013. For each indicator, \\nthe\\xa0distributions in 2012 and in the year for which \\nthe most recent data are available are presented to \\nshow changes over time. \\nLICs and LMICs together carried the brunt of the \\nlow birthweight burden among newborns in both \\n2012 and 2020 – a total of 84\\xa0percent of the global \\nburden of low birthweight in 2020 – while the two \\ncountry income groups together represented only \\n70\\xa0percent of global annual births. Overall, the \\ndistribution of the burden across income groups \\nremained similar between 2012 and 2020. The \\nproportion of low birthweight in LICs increased \\nfrom 15\\xa0percent to 18\\xa0percent, in parallel with the \\nfastest global population growth. \\nWorldwide, the largest proportion of exclusively \\nbreastfed infants live in LICs or LMICs, and the \\ncombined estimate did not change from 2012 \\nto 2021 (75\\xa0percent).

It also \\nhighlights that LICs and LMICs combined carry \\nthe greatest burden for low birthweight, stunting, \\nwasting and overweight. \\nProgress towards ending all forms of \\nmalnutrition by 2030\\nGlobal progress\\nGlobal progress towards the five nutrition \\n2030 targets for which indicators have been \\nupdated is summarized in Figure\\xa014. The 2020 low \\nbirthweight prevalence of 14.7\\xa0percent has not \\ndeclined quickly enough to be on track for the \\n2030 target of a 30\\xa0percent reduction from the \\n2012 baseline. The available low birthweight \\ndata suffer from data quality issues, especially \\namong countries that are most likely to have \\nhigh prevalence, and nearly one in three \\nnewborns in the world were not weighed at \\nbirth in 2020. Improvements in low birthweight \\ndata quality and representativeness are needed \\nto assess the severity and magnitude of the \\nproblem more reliably.\\nThe proportion of exclusively breastfed infants \\nunder six months of age increased from \\n37 .0\\xa0percent in 2012 to 47 .7\\xa0percent in 2021. \\nAlthough this is close to the 50\\xa0percent target \\nfor 2025, the world is not on track to achieve \\nthe 2030 target of at least 70\\xa0percent. To achieve \\nthis target, sustained investment is needed in \\neffective interventions that promote the adoption \\nand continuation of exclusive breastfeeding (such \\nas adequate paid maternity leave and workplace \\npolicies to ensure nearby access to quality \\nchildcare, breastfeeding breaks and dedicated \\nnursing spaces), along with greater protection \\nand support for breastfeeding in emergency \\ncontexts. Enactment and enforcement of the \\nInternational Code of Marketing of Breastmilk \\nSubstitutes, 42 institutionalization of the \\nBaby-friendly Hospital Initiative, 43 and scaling \\nup of antenatal and postnatal breastfeeding \\ncounselling will also help countries to reach their \\nindividual targets.\\nStunting in children under five years of \\nage decreased from 26.3\\xa0percent in 2012 to \\n22.3\\xa0percent in 2022. To be on track for the \\ntarget of a 13.5\\xa0percent stunting prevalence \\nin 2030, however, the prevalence needed to \\nreach 18.2\\xa0percent in 2022. Strong progress \\nhas been made, but larger investments in \\nnutrition-appropriate policies and actions across \\nmultiple systems will be required to ensure \\ngreater strides are made in reducing stunting.\\nThe global prevalence of wasting among \\nchildren under five years of age did not change \\nsignificantly from 2012 to 2022, declining from \\n7 .5\\xa0percent to 6.8\\xa0percent. The 2022 estimate is \\nmore than double the 2030 target of less than \\n3\\xa0percent. These results signal that greater \\ntargeting of resources is needed towards those \\ncountries with the highest burden to increase \\ntheir access to essential actions for the prevention \\nof child wasting across multiple systems, \\nincluding health, water and sanitation, education, \\nand social policy. To ensure achievement of the \\nglobal targets, scaling up of early detection, \\noptimized treatments, and monitoring and \\ndelivery of effective services for reducing child \\nwasting are needed, as per the Global Action \\nPlan on Child Wasting. 44\\nTo achieve the 2030 target of 3\\xa0percent for child \\noverweight, a shift is required in the direction of \\nthe global trend. The prevalence of overweight \\nremained stagnant at 5.5\\xa0percent in 2012 and \\n5.6\\xa0percent in 2022. To address overweight and \\nobesity in the youngest age groups, it is critical \\nto invest in effective promotion and adoption of \\npositive habits including healthy feeding patterns, \\navoiding easy access to foods high in sugars, \\nsalt\\xa0and fats, as well as active play and other \\ntypes of physical activity. 45\\nRegional progress\\nThis section presents an assessment of the \\nprogress towards the 2030 global nutrition targets \\nat the regional and subregional levels. The \\nregional and subregional analysis is based on \\nthe annual average rate of reduction 46 observed \\nfrom trends between the baseline and the most \\nrecent year of the indicator, compared to the rate \\nof reduction needed between 2012 and 2030 to \\nreach the global targets.

The global trends \\nin stunting, wasting, exclusive breastfeeding \\nand low birthweight must be accelerated, \\nwhile for overweight in children they will \\nhave to be reversed, to achieve the 2030 global \\nnutrition targets.\\nUrban–rural differences in  \\nnutrition indicators\\nIn the past, urban children held a distinct \\nadvantage of being better nourished than rural \\nchildren. 47 The higher incomes and improved \\nfood access and availability associated with urban \\nresidence allowed children to obtain more regular \\nand diverse diets as well as access to health \\nservices, potable water and sanitation. But\\xa0with \\ncontinued urbanization and the rapid rise in \\nurban poor, there is now a larger population \\ndependent on the most easily available and \\ninexpensive foods which are often not nutritious \\nor hygienic, increasing the risk of malnutrition. \\nRural populations often depend on agriculture for \\ntheir livelihoods. At the same time, the poorest \\npopulations are typically found in agricultural \\nregions across and within countries. Hence, when \\nother labour opportunities arise, people often \\nmove away from poorly compensated agricultural \\nwork, which reinforces the paradox that in \\nagricultural regions, the population and notably \\nits children are more likely to be malnourished. 48 \\nIn fact, it has been demonstrated that proximity \\nto agricultural food production does not translate \\ninto healthier diets for children. The 2022 report \\non child food poverty found a higher prevalence \\nof severe food poverty (consuming foods from \\nonly two food groups or less per day) among \\nchildren living in rural areas. 49 \\nUrban–rural differences in stunting and \\nwasting arise in part from disparities in access \\nto health care, water, sanitation and a hygienic \\nenvironment. 50 Implementation of key public \\nhealth interventions across the continuum of \\ncare helps to improve the health and nutritional \\nstatus of children and mothers, through provision \\nof care at first-line health facilities.

This process is fast-changing, context \\nspecific and driven by intertwined factors, \\nincluding diverse economic developments \\n(e.g.\\xa0increasing agricultural productivity), \\npolicy choices, availability of natural resources, \\nand external stressors such as conflict, climate \\nextremes or environmental degradation. \\nMany parts of the world have rapidly urbanized \\nsince the Second World War, with the urban share \\nof the world’s population rising from 30\\xa0percent in \\n1950 to 57\\xa0percent in 2021. It is projected to reach \\n68\\xa0percent by 2050. 1 In most regions, this has \\nbeen largely driven by structural transformation, \\nwhich entails an economic transformation from \\nmainly agriculture to a more diversified national \\neconomy, in the process attracting rural people \\nto urban areas. 2\\nThe structural transformation of economies is \\ncharacterized by improvements in productivity, \\nespecially of labour, and changes in the relative \\nimportance of sectors through the reallocation \\nof production factors such as labour and capital. 3 \\nThis entails four interrelated processes: i) a \\ndeclining share of agriculture in gross domestic \\nproduct (GDP) and employment, and a gradual \\nshift of jobs from the primary agriculture sector \\nto secondary and tertiary sector jobs, typically \\nlocated in urban areas; ii) rural-to-urban \\nmigration; iii) the rise of a modern industrial and \\nservice economy; and iv) a demographic transition \\nfrom high to low rates of births and deaths. 2,\\xa04,\\xa05,\\xa06 \\nAs the relationship between agriculture and the \\nrest of the economy changes, rural transformation \\noccurs.

Improvements in agricultural \\nproductivity are a necessary condition for such \\na process to result in reductions in rural poverty \\nand overall improvements in living standards.\\nHowever, the theory that urbanization goes hand \\nin hand with economic growth and structural \\ntransformation does not hold for all countries \\nand regions.  Although countries with a high \\nshare of urban population are often more \\nprosperous than countries with a large rural \\npopulation, this is not true in all cases. 8 Figure 17 \\nshows that although a trend can be seen between \\nGDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) \\nand level of urbanization (measured by the share \\nof the urban population), there is no one-to-one \\nassociation. For example, in 2019, 91\\xa0percent of \\nJordan’s population was urban, but this country’s \\nGDP per capita was relatively low at almost \\n10\\xa0000 PPP dollars per year. Likewise, in Gabon, \\n90\\xa0percent of the population was living in cities \\nin 2019, but the country’s GDP per capita was \\naround 15\\xa0000 PPP dollars per year. Small island \\ncountries and territories (Antigua and Barbuda, \\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and Aruba), as well as \\nsmall landlocked countries, have lower levels \\nof urbanization than expected considering their \\nrelatively high GDP per capita.\\nUrbanization without structural transformation \\nand economic growth occurred in some of the \\npoorest countries in the late twentieth century. 9 \\nAs in the cases above, the increase in share of \\npopulation in cities does not necessarily indicate \\nhigh economic growth. Rather urbanization is \\nassociated with other “atypical” developments. \\nFirst, overall population growth leads to \\ngrowth in both urban and rural areas. Without \\nincreases in agricultural productivity, rural \\npopulation growth results in land subdivision, \\nunviable farming plots and a lack of livelihood \\nopportunities in rural areas. Rural inhabitants \\nthen migrate to cities where opportunities may \\nbe limited (because of the lack of economic \\ngrowth), resulting in increases in urban poverty. \\nSecond, urban population growth stretches the \\ncapacity of urban infrastructure and social and \\nother services to the limit. This is particularly \\nthe case for rapidly growing urban areas, \\nwhere investments have not kept pace with \\nurban expansion. \\n FIGURE 16   DRIVERS OF URBANIZATION\\nSOURCE: de Bruin, S. & Holleman, C.

Some \\nof the poorest and most vulnerable groups \\n(including women, children and the elderly) can \\nbecome trapped in rural areas, their mobility \\nconstrained by insufficient resources or social \\nnorms. Evidence also indicates that others may \\nchoose to remain in high-risk areas due to a \\nstrong attachment to their ancestral land and \\nlivelihoods. 21 While migration to cities presents \\nrisks and opportunities, those who remain in \\nrural areas, whether willingly or unwillingly, are \\ndisproportionately vulnerable to climate change \\nimpacts, which will have adverse implications for \\ntheir future livelihoods and food security. \\nWhere there are recurrent climate shocks, \\npatterns of movement can become cyclical, \\npre-emptive and permanent because of perceived \\nfuture risk. For example, evidence from \\nBangladesh suggests that around 22\\xa0percent of \\nrural households affected by tidal-surge floods, \\nand 16\\xa0percent of those affected by riverbank \\nerosion, have migrated to urban areas. 22 Evidence \\nfrom sub-Saharan Africa shows that, between \\n1960 and 2000, nearly 50\\xa0percent of net migration l \\n(estimated at 5\\xa0million people) was due to changes \\nin temperature and rainfall, which affected \\nagricultural production and brought about a \\nreduction in farm incomes and rural wages, thus \\nspurring rural-to-urban movements. 23\\nSending one or more family members into cities to \\nwork in sectors other than agriculture, especially \\nfor poor rural households, is often important in \\norder to reduce the risks of hunger and extreme \\npoverty, and to cope with possible adverse \\nshocks the household might face. For example, \\nevidence from the Sidama District in southern \\nEthiopia shows that households whose members \\nwere anxious about a decrease in quality and \\nquantity of food were more likely to decide that \\nan adult should migrate in search of employment \\nto support better lives for themselves and the \\nfamily. 24 Additional evidence from the same \\ncountry confirmed these results: for households \\nwithout a migrant member, the inability to feed \\nthe family compared to neighbouring households \\nwith migrant members increased by four times \\nthe propensity to send out a migrant for work. 25\\nThere is also an increasing occurrence of \\nforced displacement from rural areas to urban \\nareas, often as a result of disasters and/or \\nconflict. Displaced populations are increasingly \\nconcentrating in cities, with 61\\xa0percent of the \\n26\\xa0million refugees, 26 and two out of three \\ninternally displaced persons, residing in urban \\nareas in 2019. 27 \\nPatterns and dynamics of urbanization \\nWith urban expansion and improving road and \\ncommunication infrastructure across ever larger \\nparts of rural areas, the distinction between rural \\nand urban areas is increasingly blurred.

This methodology classifies the entire territory \\nof a country across a rural–urban continuum, 36 \\nby\\xa0degree of urbanization. The classification \\nsystem consists of three classes – cities, towns \\nand semi-dense areas, and rural areas – and seven \\nsubclasses for the rural and semi-dense areas, based \\non population size and density, using the same \\nthresholds across the globe, and thus ensuring global \\ncomparability. 37 The outcome is an open-access \\ngeospatial dataset. This official classification system \\nis used for the first time in Chapter\\xa02, to look at \\ndifferences in SDG\\xa0Indicator 2.1.2 (prevalence \\nof moderate or severe food insecurity in the \\npopulation based on the Food Insecurity Experience \\nScale [FIES]) among rural, peri-urban and urban \\npopulations around the world.\\nTo explore how urbanization shapes agrifood \\nsystems, a more granular lens of the rural–urban \\ncontinuum is useful. For this reason another \\npublically available global geospatial dataset – \\nUrban Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) – is used \\nfor the country case study analysis in Chapter\\xa04. \\nThis newly available global geospatial dataset \\nprovides a global mapping of the rural–urban \\ncontinuum, 28,\\xa038  based on the Global Human \\nSettlement Layer. 39 Like the DEGURBA classification, \\nit places urban centres on a gradient based on \\npopulation size and density, whereby city size is a \\nproxy for the breadth of services and opportunities \\nprovided by an urban centre. But it also adds a \\nsecond dimension: rural locations are assigned a \\ngradient of their own, using the shortest travel time \\nto urban centres of various sizes as a proxy for the \\ncost of accessing goods, services and employment \\nopportunities (Figure\\xa0A). Thus, the URCA dataset \\ndisaggregates rural areas into multiple categories; \\ndistinguishing, for example, between locations that \\nare less than 1 hour from an urban centre (in yellow) \\nand those that are farther away. \\nThe URCA methodology for defining urban–rural \\ncatchment areas provides a spatial and functional \\nrepresentation of the connection between rural \\nareas and urban centres, giving new insights into the \\ndegree of connectivity between rural and urban areas \\nand the diversity of patterns in rural–urban linkages \\naround the world. Spatial representation refers to \\nthe geographical and locational distribution of the \\npopulation (i.e.\\xa0what area it occurs in and how spread \\nout it is). Functional representation entails how \\nthese areas relate to each other in terms of activities \\nand purpose (i.e.\\xa0access of rural locations to urban \\nservices and opportunities, captured by the size of \\nthe closest urban centre and the associated travel \\ntime from the rural location). This categorization, \\nwhen combined with household survey data, allows \\nfor a more detailed analysis regarding consumption \\nand production across the rural–urban continuum \\n(see Chapter\\xa04).\\n| 48 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 78, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n BOX 2   (Continued)\\n FIGURE A   RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM BASED ON THE URBAN RURAL CATCHMENT AREAS (URCA) DATASET\\nTOWNS SMALL CITIES INTERMEDIATE CITIES LARGE CITIES\\nRURAL\\n0\\nTRAVEL TIME TO URBAN\\nCENTRE OF REFERENCE\\n0–1 hour\\n1–2 hours\\n2–3 hours\\n>3 hours\\nTWO-DIMENSIONAL \\nRURAL–URBAN \\nCONTINUUM \\n(URCA)\\nONE-DIMENSIONAL \\nRURAL–URBAN \\nCONTINUUM\\nNOTES: The figure is a stylized representation of the URCA-defined rural–urban continuum which has a two-dimensional gradient and the more common \\none-dimensional conceptualization of a rural–urban continuum.

This is because intermediate and \\nsmall cities, also referred to as “secondary cities” , m \\nplay a pivotal role in providing input and output \\nmarket opportunities for rural populations not \\nresiding close to the large cities.

This, in turn, as urban populations \\ngrow, translates into vast increases in the total \\namount of food that agrifood systems have to \\nproduce, process and distribute over time. There \\nmay also be slower growth or even declines in \\ndemand for other food products sold such as \\ntraditional grains, maize, roots and tubers. \\nAdjustments in the quantity and quality of food \\ndemand and supply bring about changes in \\nmarkets and retail trade; midstream food supply \\nchains (changes in post-harvest systems for \\nlogistics, processing, wholesale and distribution); \\nrural input markets; agricultural technology; and \\nthe size distribution of farms. 14,\\xa056  Thus, agrifood \\nsystems are transformed, from traditional and \\nmostly rural systems based on local market \\nlinkages and farming employment, to systems \\nwith greater connectivity between rural areas, \\nand between rural, peri-urban and urban \\nareas. This entails more complex rural–urban \\nmarket linkages across a spatial and functional \\nrural–urban continuum, and more diverse \\nemployment opportunities along the food value \\nchain, including processing, marketing and trade. \\nIt also entails more dependence on income and \\nfood pricing (affordability) for dietary choices, as \\nthere is a greater dependence on purchased foods. \\nOf specific concern against this backdrop are the \\nchanges in the supply and demand of nutritious \\nfoods that constitute a healthy diet; their cost \\nrelative to foods of high energy density and \\nminimal nutritional value, which are often high in \\nfats, sugars and/or salt; and their cost relative to \\npeople’s income (i.e. their affordability). \\nFigure 20  presents a conceptual framework for \\nunderstanding the different pathways through \\nwhich urbanization is driving changes in agrifood \\nsystems across the rura l–u rban continuum, and is, \\nin turn, affecting access to affordable healthy diets . \\nThe orange text  throughout this section refers \\nto specific elements in Figure 20  for emphasis \\nand to ease cross-referencing with the figure. \\nThe framework was developed based on a \\nsystematic review and meta-analysis of evidence \\nfrom scientific studies o and informed by new \\nanalysis presented in Chapter\\xa04 on changes in \\nfood demand and supply across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum.

Higher average incomes, combined \\nwith changing lifestyles and employment, \\nare driving a dietary transition. While this is \\noccurring in countries and regions at different \\nspeeds and with variations, it is happening \\naround the world. This transition is characterized \\nby changes in the types and quantities of food \\nconsumed, with diets shifting beyond traditional \\ngrains into dairy, fish, meat, vegetables and fruits, \\nbut also into consumption of more processed \\nfoods p and convenience foods or food away from \\nhome. These changing preferences are reinforced \\nby the greater diversity of both food products and \\np Food processing can facilitate the promotion of high-quality diets, \\nas it can make food more available as well as safer. However, highly \\nprocessed foods can contain very high densities of salt, free sugars and \\nsaturated or trans fats, and these products, when consumed in high \\namounts, can undermine diet quality. Free sugars are all sugars added \\nto foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as \\nsugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice \\nconcentrates.

Dietary preferences are also shaped \\nby marketing and other supply factors, with \\na reinforcing compounding effect on the food \\nproduced, supplied and consumed. \\nHowever, urbanization has also contributed to \\nthe spread and consumption of processed and highly \\nprocessed foods , which are increasingly cheap, \\nreadily available and marketed, with private \\nsector small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \\nand larger companies often setting the nutrition \\nlandscape. Cost comparisons of individual food \\nitems and/or food groups from existing studies \\nindicate that the cost of nutritious foods – such \\nas fruits, vegetables and animal source foods – is \\ntypically higher than the cost of energy-dense \\nfoods high in fats, sugars and/or salt, and of \\nstaple foods, oils and sugars. 62,\\xa063,\\xa064,\\xa065  The relative \\nprices of nutritious foods and foods of high \\nenergy density and minimal nutritional value \\nhave also been shown to differ systematically \\nacross income levels and regions. 62,\\xa066,\\xa067\\nWith urbanization, purchases from supermarkets, \\nfastfood takeaway outlets, home deliveries and \\ne-suppliers and other convenience retailers \\nare increasing. 68,\\xa069,\\xa070  In Latin America and the \\nCaribbean, for example, there has been a profound \\nshift in the last 20 years towards foods of high \\nenergy density and minimal nutritional value, \\nincluding sugar-sweetened beverages.

At the same time, men \\nare increasingly working far from home in other \\ncities. These trends are driving the purchase of \\npre-prepared or ready-to-eat cereals such as rice \\nand wheat, 73,\\xa074  along with more processed foods \\nand food away from home  prepared by restaurants, \\ncanteens, retailers, etc. 18 The food processing \\nsector and fastfood segment have grown quickly \\nas a result.

The rural poor \\nare heavily engaged in purchasing food from \\nmarkets and are, in general, net food buyers. In \\nEastern and Southern Africa, research shows \\nrural households buy 44\\xa0percent (in value \\nterms) of the food they consume. 77 A study of \\nBangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and Viet Nam \\nshows rural households buy an even higher \\nproportion of their food – 73\\xa0percent (in value \\nterms). 78 Moreover, new research presented in \\nChapter\\xa04 also shows that food purchases form \\nthe majority (average 56 percent) of the foods \\nconsumed (in\\xa0value terms) by rural households \\nin 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Ultimately, the \\nshift towards more supermarkets has been driven \\nby a range of factors including rising incomes, \\nchanging lifestyles, marketing and increasing \\nawareness of food safety and quality. 115,\\xa0116,\\xa0117  \\nWhile supermarkets can be linked to increased \\naccess to nutritious foods, 118 and modern food \\ntechnology has provided benefits in terms \\nof reducing waste, enhancing sanitation and \\nreducing adverse effects of seasonality, 109 \\nthey have also been associated with increased \\nsupply of energ y-d ense and highly processed \\nfoods .81,\\xa0119,\\xa0120,\\xa0121,\\xa0122,\\xa0123  The substantial expansion \\nin the types, varieties and quantities of highly \\nprocessed foods sold worldwide can be associated \\nwith the expansion of supermarkets and \\nhypermarkets, the industrialization of agrifood \\nsystems, technological change, and globalization \\nincluding market growth and the political \\nactivities of transnational food corporations. \\nWhile there are wide variations between \\nregions and countries, sales of highly processed \\nfoods are highest in Oceania and the Pacific, \\nNorthern America, Europe and Latin America, \\nbut are also growing rapidly in Asia, the Near \\nEast and Africa. 119 \\nDespite the greater penetration of formal markets \\nsuch as supermarkets and hypermarkets, open \\nand wet markets, as well as informal kiosks \\nand street vendors, are still important for local \\nurban food cultures in many countries around \\nthe world, particularly in Asia and Africa. 117 \\nHere, the low average annual income per \\nperson is seen as an important limitation for \\nsupermarkets to expand. 124 \\nPoor urban dwellers especially buy most \\nof their food at informal markets or street \\nshops.

For instance, in Meru, United Republic \\nof Tanzania, urbanization has stimulated the \\ndemand for milk, providing a reliable source \\nof income for smallholders in a region facing \\na scarcity of (fertile) land. 137  Improved access \\nto inputs and the support of stable institutions \\nwere important conditions that facilitated this \\nintensification, resulting in higher incomes. \\nThe effects of urbanization can spread to \\nagricultural zones quite far from towns and cities, \\ndepending on the connectivity between rural and \\nurban areas, which is shaped by the proximity \\nto cities and by existing transport routes. 138 \\nThis can be seen in the rural regions around \\nDelhi, India. Vegetables and dairy products are \\nbecoming increasingly important components \\nof consumption not only in high-income urban \\nhouseholds, but also in low- and middle-income \\nurban households. As a result of these changes \\nin urban consumption, the rural areas around \\nDelhi, which used to be cultivated with cereals, \\nare now increasingly being diversified to \\nvegetable production and livestock keeping, \\nand productivity is rising. 139  The far-reaching \\ninfluence of urbanization is also seen in fisheries, \\nwhere it has impacted fishers' ability to meet the \\nrising cost of living in fishing communities. 140\\nAt the same time, millions of smallholders in less \\naccessible or detached hinterlands remain cut \\noff from the opportunities that growing urban \\nfood markets can bring. 141 In more isolated rural \\nareas, agricultural growth is limited due to low \\nproductivity and high transportation costs. 138 \\nFarmers with limited access to urban markets \\nhave few opportunities to profit from urban \\ndevelopment. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, \\nthe adoption of high-input technology and crop \\nproductivity is found to be negatively correlated \\nwith travel time to urban centres. 142\\nAnother important direct impact of urban \\nexpansion is lan d-u se change . In some countries, \\nfarmers receive high compensation for selling \\ntheir land, 143  whereas in others, dispossession of \\nagricultural land is not compensated, resulting \\nin a loss of livelihoods and issues around land \\nrights. As farms in peri-urban areas make \\nvoluntary or involuntary room for urban \\nexpansion and associated infrastructure, they \\noften move farther away from cities and convert \\nmore remote natural areas (mostly forests and \\nscrublands) into new farmland, negatively \\naffecting habitat quality and biodiversity, \\nand causing environmental degradation and \\ndeforestation. 144,\\xa0145,\\xa0146,\\xa0147  In\\xa0some cases, farmers \\nare driven to use less productive lands in more \\nremote villages, or are restricted to unauthorized \\npublic spaces. 148,\\xa0149  What is more, converted lands \\nare less fertile than arable lands around cities, \\nleading to a loss in agricultural productivity that \\nis higher than the absolute loss of land. 150  Meeting \\nfood production and demand for an urbanizing \\npopulation when land availability and quality are \\nreduced requires agricultural intensification; this \\nimplies intensive use of energy, land and water, \\nwhich if not managed to mitigate against climate \\nchange, can lead to an increase in greenhouse gas \\nemissions. 151,\\xa0152,\\xa0153,\\xa0154  \\nWith urbanization continuing, the resultant loss \\nof cropland is expected to be 3\\xa0percent in the \\nwhole of Asia and Africa by 2030. The production \\nloss, however, is 6\\xa0and 9\\xa0percent (respectively), \\nbecause (as stated above) agricultural land around \\ncities is often more fertile – an important reason \\nwhy cities historically developed where they did. \\nAdditionally, farmers close to cities are often \\nmore productive due to higher input use and \\nknowledge levels. 150  Therefore, the productivity \\nloss is higher than the absolute loss of land. In \\nmost countries, production is relocated, although \\nthis is not possible everywhere – in Egypt, \\nfor instance, the amount of arable and fertile \\nland is limited. 155\\nUrbanization can also affect farm size in various \\nways.

There are however \\nsome important overarching challenges and \\nopportunities concerning urbanization across \\nthe rural–urban continuum. Figure 21  summarizes \\nthe most important of these, drawing from \\nthe previous sections on how urbanization is \\naffecting agrifood systems, as well as further \\nempirical evidence and studies. Although the \\nchallenges outnumber the opportunities, this \\nis not per se the case for the magnitude of the \\nimpacts on access to affordable healthy diets.\\nIn recent years, many studies have focused \\non urbanization and agrifood systems \\ntransformation; nevertheless there is limited \\ncommon understanding of how the nexus \\nof these two processes affects both access to \\naffordable healthy diets and food security and \\nnutrition, and even fewer studies have applied \\na rural–urban continuum lens. Data to support \\nsuch a disaggregated rural–urban continuum \\nanalysis are extremely limited; the analysis \\nrequires household survey data with geospatial \\nlocational data, and for most countries in the \\nworld such data are not readily available. \\nChapter\\xa04 explores this question through a new \\nanalysis on variations in food demand, economic \\naccess to healthy diets, and food security and \\nnutrition across the rural–urban continuum, \\nusing selected country case studies as far as data \\navailability allowed. \\nWhat we do know is that empirical evidence \\nreveals socioeconomic disparities in access \\nto affordable healthy diets throughout the \\nrural–urban continuum as a result of a number of \\nstructural challenges. 62,\\xa0157  These include economic \\nchallenges related to the high cost of nutritious \\nfoods ( Figure 21), which varies within countries \\nand can be even higher in poor neighbourhoods. \\nFor urban populations living in poverty, the \\nmost easily available and affordable diets tend \\nto be unhealthy. 158  Access to nutritious foods is \\noften limited, as these types of foods are more \\nexpensive, or in some cases unavailable, in more \\nurbanized areas. Poorer households are inclined \\nto prioritize meeting dietary energy requirements \\nover nutritional quality, spending their resources \\non more affordable foods, which tend to be of \\nhigh energy density and minimal nutritional \\nvalue.158,\\xa0159  Other structural barriers are found in \\nagrifood supply systems and markets, impeding \\nphysical access to healthy diets (resulting in food \\ndeserts and swamps in urban areas, for example). \\nFor other income groups of urban dwellers, \\nan important challenge to access to affordable \\nhealthy diets is that urban centres have more \\nsupermarkets and especially fastfood chains, \\nincluding multinational outlets, offering a \\nready and abundant supply of highly processed \\nfoods, as well as energy-dense snacks, sweets, \\nand sugar-sweetened beverages ( Figure 21). \\nThese developments have negatively affected \\nobesity levels and health conditions of urban \\ndwellers. 160,\\xa0161  It is important to note that while \\nsupermarkets have an advantage in selling highly \\nprocessed foods because of economies of scale, a \\ngrowing number of small shops are also selling \\nthese products. 54, 69\\xa0 The rapidly increasing share \\nof highly processed foods of high energy density \\nand minimal nutritional value, especially in \\nurban consumption patterns, is linked to the rise \\nin obesity and non-communicable diseases. 54 \\nIn many countries, obesity levels have risen \\nalongside urbanization. New evidence for Africa \\nsuggests that consumption of highly processed \\nfoods and high-calorie snacks and beverages \\nis spreading across the full spectrum of the \\nrural–urban continuum, even among the rural \\npoor – a trend of great concern (see Section\\xa04.1 ).\\nRecent empirical studies show that the risk of \\nfood insecurity can even be higher in urban \\nareas than in rural areas, due to the intra-urban \\ninequalities present in many rapidly urbanized »\\n| 64 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 94, 'page_label': '65'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n FIGURE 21   CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN ACCESSING AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS THE \\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM\\nWidespread diﬀusion of food purchases \\nin rural areas\\nRising income for farmers well connected to cities due to improved \\nproductivity and diversiﬁcation following rising demand  \\nUrban and peri-urban agricultural production creating employment, generating \\nopportunities for small businesses and increasing supply of nutritious foods \\nAs urban areas grow closer to rural areas – better access to agricultural inputs and services \\nallowing improved productivity, lower prices and rising incomes\\nGreater oﬀ-farm opportunities in midstream \\nfood supply chains\\nMore employment opportunities \\nin downstream food supply chains\\nMore diversiﬁed diets, including dairy, ﬁsh, \\nmeat, vegetables, fruits and legumes\\nGreater demand for convenience, pre-prepared, \\nready-to-eat and fast foods\\nHigh cost of nutritious foods relative to the cost of processed, \\nenergy-dense foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt  \\nSpread of processed foods of high energy density and minimal nutritional value \\nthat are readily available and cheap\\n Increased supply of diverse nutritious foods \\nbut at a very high cost that is unaﬀordable for the poor\\nLarge-scale expansion of supermarkets and hypermarkets supplying \\ncheap highly processed foods of minimal nutritional value \\nFood deserts and swamps, and limited access  \\nand aﬀordability for low-income groups\\nIncreased supply of convenience, pre-prepared, ready-to-eat and fast foods \\nthat are often energy dense and high in fats, sugars and/or salt\\nLoss of income opportunities due to exclusion from value chains \\nof small farmers due to value chain formalization\\nInsuﬃcient production and high prices \\nfor vegetables and fruits \\n(Peri-)urban agricultural livelihoods\\n threatened by urban expansion \\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAINS – MIDSTREAM (logistics, processing and wholesale)\\nFOOD SUPPLY – PRODUCTION\\nAGRIFOOD SYSTEMS\\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM\\nRural areas far away from cities Towns and small cities Large cities\\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOUR AND DIETS\\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAINS – DOWNSTREAM (marketing, retail and trade) \\nChallenges to access aﬀordable healthy diets Opportunities to access aﬀordable healthy diets\\nSOURCE: de Bruin, S. & Holleman, C.

Access \\nto food – nutritious foods in particular – across \\nthe rural–urban continuum is complex, with \\nmultiple determinants. It cannot be assumed \\nthat this access is always better for populations \\nin urban areas. In fact, several studies show \\nthat the so-called “urban advantage” does not \\nbenefit the poorest, who – on the contrary – \\nface disproportionate barriers to accessing and \\nconsuming a healthy diet and have an increased \\nrisk of food insecurity and malnutrition. 157 \\nFurthermore, when migration decisions reflect \\nthe push factors in rural areas (e.g. conflict or \\nlack of access to land) rather than the pull of \\nbetter opportunities in urban areas, food security \\nand nutrition outcomes can be compromised \\n(Figure 21).10 Challenges around accessing food and \\nthe risk of food insecurity among rural–urban \\nmigrants are intensified during crises. 163,\\xa0164,\\xa0165  \\nRural–urban migrants who often inhabit informal \\nsettlements lack social protection coverage and \\ntheir neighbourhoods often fall outside the remit \\nof urban planning. The COVID-19 pandemic is an \\nexample of a situation in which low-income and \\ninformal rural–urban migrants experienced food \\ninsecurity in cities. \\nFood insecurity in urban areas is strongly driven \\nby income limitations; low-income households \\nneed to allocate a high proportion of their total \\nexpenditure to food and are extremely vulnerable \\nto external shocks including unemployment, \\nhealth problems and food price inflation. 157 \\nFood insecurity can be further compounded by \\npoor health, as low-income urban households \\ntend to have poor sanitation and a low standard \\nof other essential housing infrastructure and \\ngoods. 166,\\xa0167,\\xa0168  Urban poverty poses diverse \\nchallenges that prevent access to healthy diets \\n(e.g. unplanned built environments), and \\nchallenging social network structures often \\nprevent low-income households from finding \\nstrategies to cope with food insecurity. Social \\nprotection and food assistance programmes \\ndesigned to facilitate food access – such as \\nmonetary or in-kind transfer schemes, community \\nkitchens and food banks – are often insufficient \\nby themselves to fully resolve food insecurity \\nproblems, because they do not address barriers \\nsuch as lack of cooking facilities or food storage, \\nand competing health or housing expenses.\\nOn the other hand, in rural areas, urbanization \\ncan provide opportunities for on- and off-farm \\nemployment ( Figure 21), thus increasing purchasing \\npower and options to access healthy diets. \\nEspecially in rural communities where agriculture \\ncompletely dominates the economy, the growth \\nof small cities and towns can play an important \\nrole in providing access to inputs, markets and \\nnon-farm activities, thus reducing poverty and \\nimproving food security. 169 However, there are \\nalso risks of losing or decreasing opportunities \\nto sustain livelihoods due to formalization \\nprocesses. For example, fees for stalls in formal \\nmarkets are often relatively expensive, which \\ndecreases the accessibility of these markets for \\nmany small-scale farmers and traders. Nearly \\nall smallholder farmers, most traders in food \\nmarkets and many micro- and small-scale food \\nprocessors and food retailers are not part of the \\nformal food economy in sub-Saharan Africa, 170 \\nand improvements in formal markets will not \\nbenefit these actors. Thus there is a risk that \\nsmallholders, small-scale food processors and \\nfood retailers be excluded from formalizing \\nvalue chains. Understanding how to best sustain \\ninformal value chains is critical; however, this \\nknowledge is often lacking. 171 \\nThe rural-to-urban outmigration of young \\npeople, often men, also poses both challenges \\nand opportunities in terms of improving \\naccess to affordable healthy diets ( Figure 21). \\nIn\\xa0some contexts, rural outmigration can result \\nin substantial remittances that increase the \\naccessibility of healthy diets and improve \\nfood security in rural areas. 172,\\xa0173  Households \\nthat receive remittances can be better off in \\nterms of total income, assets, calorie supply \\nand micronutrient supply. 174 Rural-to-urban \\nmigration can also contribute to resilience in the \\ncommunities of origin and further the transfer of \\nknowledge and other resources besides financial \\nremittances. 175 However, there are instances \\nwhere remittances are too low (or even absent) \\n»\\n| 66 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 96, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nto replace the lost workers with hired labour. 176 \\nIn such cases, the lost labour and associated \\nreduction in income or agricultural produce \\ncan result in decreased access to healthy diets, \\nor in longer working hours for the left-behind \\nwomen in subsistence farming to maintain \\nhousehold food security. \\nIn terms of malnutrition, studies generally show \\nthat rural populations face a higher burden of \\nchild undernutrition than urban populations, 177,\\xa0178  \\nnot only but especially in sub-Saharan Africa, a \\nsubregion where many households still live in \\nremote rural areas.

Furthermore, and broadly in keeping \\nwith previous analyses of rural–urban inequality \\nin nutrition, it appears that the majority of \\nthis nutritional disadvantage is explained by \\ndifferences in wealth, education, health and \\nnon-road infrastructure services across rural \\nand urban areas. 185\\nIn conclusion, access to affordable healthy diets is \\ngenerally better and food security and nutrition \\nlevels are higher in cities than in rural areas \\nbecause of the better availability of food, higher \\naverage purchasing power in urban areas, and \\nbetter access to health care, education and other \\nservices that are essential for health and nutrition. \\nHowever, this does not always hold true given the \\ntransformations underway in agrifood systems, \\nthe stark inequalities that exist within urban \\npopulations, and the increasingly spatial and \\nfunctional connectivity between cities, towns and \\nrural catchment areas. 185,\\xa0186  New evidence from \\n11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa presented in \\nSection\\xa04.2 suggests that the “urban advantage” in \\naccessing affordable healthy diets, food security \\nand nutrition may not be as great as expected. \\nThus, it will be increasingly important to analyse \\nthese across the rural–urban continuum, and \\nto understand the patterns of urbanization and \\nconnectivity across the rural–urban continuum in \\norder to identify the challenges and opportunities \\nfor ensuring access to affordable healthy diets, \\nto\\xa0improve food security and nutrition for all. n\\n| 67 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 97, 'page_label': '68'}, page_content='DEMOCRATIC \\nREPUBLIC OF  \\nTHE CONGO\\nA man transports \\nsacks of cabbages to \\nmarket by bicycle.\\n©FAO/Olivier Asselin'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 98, 'page_label': '69'}, page_content='CHAPTER 4 \\nTHE INTERPLAY OF FOOD \\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND AND  \\nTHE COST AND AFFORDABILITY \\nOF HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS  \\nTHE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM\\nAs highlighted in Chapter 3,  a thorough \\nunderstanding of how urbanization is driving \\nchanges in agrifood systems that affect the \\navailability and affordability of healthy diets is \\nonly possible through a rural–urban continuum \\nlens.

This \\nknowledge is needed to design appropriate \\nfood, agricultural and nutrition policies, as \\nwell as related sector policies such as health, \\ncity and regional planning, and education. \\nOnly through all of these policies can agrifood \\nsystems be leveraged to deliver healthy diets \\nthat are affordable to everyone across the \\nrural–urban continuum. \\nWhile there is a substantial amount of literature \\nthat discusses the effect of urbanization on food \\ndemand, 5 sound empirical evidence that looks at \\nthe full spectrum of the rural–urban continuum \\nis still scarce and limited. To date, the majority \\nof existing research is based on the descriptive \\ncomparison of food demand between rural and \\nurban areas. While this research is important, this \\nsimple comparison does not reflect the reality of \\nchanging settlement patterns and demographic \\nshifts within a rural–urban continuum. \\nNew research suggests that the differences \\nbetween urban and rural food demand may not \\nbe as acute as previously thought (see Chapter\\xa03 ). \\nHowever, this research does not provide an \\nunderstanding of the magnitude of the differences \\nin food demand across the full spectrum of the \\nrural–urban continuum, nor an understanding of \\nthe location-related factors (i.e.\\xa0where households \\nlive in relation to various points across the \\nrural–urban continuum), and other household \\n(e.g.\\xa0socioeconomic) or food environment factors \\nthat may be driving these differences. \\nTo help bridge this gap, this section presents an \\nanalysis of food demand, defined as household \\nfood consumption (at market value) across the \\nrural–urban continuum in selected countries, \\napplying the newly available geospatial URCA \\ndataset. The URCA classification provides a \\nmore granular lens to explore the interplay of \\nfood supply and demand across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum than the Degree of Urbanization \\n(DEGURBA) classification used in Chapter 2 , \\nwhich is an\\xa0official methodology for delineating \\nurban and rural areas for international and \\nregional statistical comparisons.\\nè Given that rural households in the 11 African \\ncountries do not produce the majority of the food value \\nthey consume, the affordability of healthy diets is \\nequally critical across the rural–urban continuum. \\nè While the diffusion of processed foods, including highly \\nprocessed foods, is already advanced in Asia and Latin \\nAmerica, it is spreading quickly in Africa as well. In the \\n11 countries in Africa, rural households are consuming \\nprocessed foods, including highly processed foods, across \\nthe rural–urban continuum, even in remote rural areas. \\nè Highly processed foods are a small proportion of \\ntotal purchases and their consumption is higher in urban \\nareas; however, results show the penetration of highly \\nprocessed foods in rural areas, even those living 1 to 2 \\nhours or more from a city or town.\\nè Moving across the continuum from urban to \\nrural areas in these countries, there is an increasing \\nhousehold food consumption value share of staple foods \\nand pulses, seeds and nuts, and a decreasing value \\nshare of animal source foods and food away from home. \\nIn contrast, shares of vegetables, fruits, and fats and oils \\nare uniform across the rural–urban continuum. \\nè While animal source food consumption value shares \\nare strongly driven by income across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum, in contrast, shares of fruits and vegetables \\nare driven more by access and\\xa0availability. \\nAs highlighted in Chapter 3 , urbanization, \\ncombined with rising incomes, increases in the \\nopportunity cost of time related to work, lifestyle \\nchanges and demographic shifts, is changing \\nfood demand. These factors together with many \\nsupply-side considerations, including food \\npricing, marketing and promotion, among others, \\nin turn are changing agrifood systems, so there \\nis a reinforcing compounding effect on the food \\nproduced, supplied and consumed.  \\nMost notably, rapid urbanization is leading to \\nrising and changing food demand, and shifts \\nin patterns of food supply 1,\\xa02  – especially in \\nsub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, the two \\nregions exhibiting the highest urbanization rates. \\nProjections of overall food expenditure estimate \\nan approximate 2.5-fold increase in sub-Saharan \\nAfrica and a 1.7-fold increase in Southern Asia \\nby 2050. 1,\\xa03,\\xa04  \\n| 70 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 100, 'page_label': '71'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nThe URCA methodology defines urban centres \\nacross a rural–urban gradient based on \\npopulation size and density, whereby the city \\nsize is a proxy for the breadth of services and \\nopportunities provided by an urban centre. \\nUniquely, the URCA dataset also classifies rural \\nlocations using the shortest travel time to an \\nurban centre, as a proxy for the cost of accessing \\ngoods, services and employment opportunities \\n(see Chapter\\xa03 and Box 2).

This is based on a \\nwell-established economic law, referred to as \\nBen net t ’s law,v,\\xa08 which stipulates that diets become \\nmore diversified with higher levels of food \\nconsumption, income and employment. Thus, the \\ndifferences in food consumption point to larger \\nfood budgets providing “room” for additions \\nbeyond staple foods with increasing expenditure on \\nnon-staple products (as Bennett’s law predicts) as \\nwell as on industrially (rather than home) processed \\nfood products that reduce the opportunity cost of \\ntime for women and men engaged in employment \\n(see Chapter\\xa03 ). Usually higher food budgets are \\ncorrelated with both of these consumption changes, \\nand the two sets of countries allow this correlation \\nto be tested. This is of particular relevance when \\nseeking to understand how urbanization is driving \\nchanges in agrifood systems and how this is likely \\nto affect food demand and access to healthy diets, \\nas we shall see next.\\nt Ranking and classifying countries by income is not as relevant for a \\nfood demand analysis, because some countries have high incomes \\nlinked to the non-farm sector, and these incomes are spent on non-food \\nitems. It is also not useful to rank and classify countries by the share of \\nfood in total expenditure, for a similar reason: higher income usually \\nleads to lower food share (Engel’s law), but the food share can vary for \\nnon-income reasons, and thus it does not matter. \\nu The country “split” occurs at a food budget of roughly USD\\xa02 per \\ncapita per day. Coincidentally, it may be noticed that this split point is \\nnot far from the new World Bank extreme poverty line of USD\\xa02.15 per \\ncapita per day; however, the two are in no way related, as poverty lines \\nare income based. The list of countries analysed for this report is based \\nonly on LSMS availability, and represents neither a random sample nor \\nthe totality of countries in Africa. \\nv  In\\xa0agricultural economics\\xa0and\\xa0development economics,\\xa0Bennett’s \\nlaw\\xa0is well established, based on the observation that as incomes rise, \\npeople eat relatively fewer staples and relatively more non-staples \\nincluding some nutrient-dense foods (e.g.\\xa0meats, fruits and \\nvegetables) .8 Bennett’s law is related to\\xa0Engel’s law, which considers \\nthe relationship between rising household incomes and total food \\nspending. Engel’s law, also well established, is related to the \\nobservation that as family income increases, the percentage spent on \\nfood decreases; that spent on clothing, rent, heat and light remains the \\nsame; while that spent on education, health and recreation increases. \\nThe two country food-budget groups add a \\nfurther dimension to the analysis that relates \\nto an ongoing debate about what happens \\nin countries of high and low per capita food \\nconsumption: Are the latter just traditional, or \\nare they also changing? One expects to find more \\ndiversified diets and processed foods in urban \\nareas, as well as in places where there are higher \\nlevels of food consumption per capita, but, as we \\nshall see below, looking at food demand across \\nthe rural–urban continuum and comparing high- \\nand low-food-budget countries, this may not be \\nthe case as a rule. If the patterns of food demand \\nare the same – between either urban, peri-urban \\nand rural areas or low- and high-food-budget \\ncountries – this in itself is an important finding. \\nIndeed, the insights and messages are stronger \\nif one sees they are happening both across \\nthe rural–urban continuum and in high- and \\nlow-food-budget contexts. \\nFor the 11 African countries analysed, Figure 22 \\nshows the country population distribution across \\nten categories (i.e.\\xa0URCAs) of the rural–urban \\ncontinuum (see Table 9 for specific category \\ngrouping).

This analysis can shed some light on \\nthe magnitude and reach of the midstream food \\nvalue chains and the associated employment \\nthat this sector generates (see Chapter\\xa03 ) related \\nto both low processed and highly processed \\nfoods. w In addition, low processed foods can \\nprovide many advantages to households through \\nenhanced shelf-life, food safety, convenience, \\nand in some cases nutritional enhancement \\n(e.g.\\xa0fortification). On the other hand, many \\nhighly processed foods are energy dense and \\nhigh in fats, sugars and/or salt, and research \\nsuggests that they may contribute to overweight \\nand obesity as well as some non-communicable \\ndiseases (NCDs) (see Chapter\\xa03 ). As already \\nhighlighted, it is expected that the consumption \\nof both low processed and highly processed \\nfoods is higher with higher levels of food \\nconsumption and especially where income and \\nemployment are higher.\\nThird, household food consumption patterns are \\nanalysed examining the market value of the foods \\nconsumed by food group, which provides insights \\ninto the spread of the consumption of diverse \\ndiets among households across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum. Urbanization is generally associated \\nwith a change in consumption behaviour, \\nwith urban households usually eating a more \\ndiversified diet including more expensive foods \\nsuch as animal source foods and fruits (see \\nChapter\\xa03). However, some studies suggest that it \\nis higher income, rather than urbanization per se, \\nthat is causing these diet shifts.\\nw Note a comprehensive overview of processed foods is not provided, \\nas NOVA Group\\xa01 (unprocessed and minimally processed) is not \\nanalysed. \\nFood purchases are a major contributor to \\nhousehold food consumption across the \\nrural–urban continuum, even among the \\nrural poor\\nAcross the 11 high- and low-food-budget African \\ncountries, food purchases form the majority of \\ntotal household food consumption in value terms, \\nincluding food for home consumption and food \\nconsumed away from home ( Figure 24). While high \\nshares of food purchases relative to total food \\nconsumption among households living in urban \\nareas are to be expected (78–97 percent), shares \\nare surprisingly high across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum, even for rural households living 1 to \\n2 hours from a small city or town (56 percent on \\naverage) and for those living more than 2 hours \\nfrom any urban centre (52 percent on average). \\nThe finding that in most of the countries analysed \\nthe “majority” of household food consumption \\nin rural households is coming from purchases \\n(56 percent on average in the 11 countries \\nanalysed) is a major deviation from the traditional \\nimage of rural subsistence households ( Box\\xa05).\\nIndeed, the diffusion of high levels of food \\npurchases across the rural–urban continuum \\n(Figure 24) confirms that food markets and supply \\nchains are important to rural areas in both high- \\nand low-food-budget countries.

The uptick \\nin purchases in these areas can be explained \\nin several ways. First, farmers in remote areas \\ntend to be poorer, meaning households often \\nneed purchases to “smooth consumption” or \\ncompensate for poor harvests. Second, in furthest \\noutlying rural areas (more than 2\\xa0hours travel \\nto a city or town), local non-farm employment is \\nscarce, as are services, and therefore households \\nfocus more on migration to bring in money, \\nwhich can be used to buy food. This pattern is \\nmore marked in poorer countries, reflected in \\nthe larger uptick in Benin and Mali, the two \\nlow-food-budget countries.\\nThe traditional view of a rural–urban divide \\nformed a few decades ago, when most rural \\nareas in Africa were much poorer and less \\nconnected to urban areas. However, more \\nrecently, the urbanization occurring in many \\nAfrican countries is dispersed, with growing \\nnetworks of interconnected small cities and \\ntowns and increased connectivity with rural \\nareas. This translates directly to expansive \\ngrowth in off-farm employment opportunities, \\ninterconnected food markets and food supply \\nchains; lifestyles thus change, which in turn \\naffects how households acquire food and what \\nfoods they eat (see Chapter\\xa03 ). \\nLooking to other regions, studies show there \\nis substantial evidence of high levels of food \\npurchases in rural areas, for example in Asia, \\nincluding studies from Bangladesh, Indonesia, \\nNepal and Viet Nam. 9,\\xa010  These studies find \\nsimilar patterns of food purchases in rural \\nareas, but the convergence between urban and \\nrural food purchase patterns is more advanced \\nthan in Africa. \\nWhen household income levels are considered, \\nthe notion that rural households in sub-Saharan \\nAfrica rely primarily on subsistence farming \\nfor food still does not hold. The findings show \\nthat food purchases represent 50\\xa0percent or \\nmore of total household food consumption \\n(including own production valued at market \\nprices) across all income groups in rural \\nareas of most of the countries, which is by no \\nmeans low. The main exception is Ethiopia, \\nwhich drags down the average share of food \\npurchases for high-food-budget countries \\n(Figure 24). Ethiopia is an outlier case among the \\nhigh-food-budget countries, as its pattern of \\nurbanization “straddles” the divide between \\n“dense metropolitan” and “small city and town \\ndispersed” (see Figure\\xa0A6.1  in Annex\\xa06 ), with poorer \\noutlier rural areas not well connected due to very \\npoor or limited road infrastructure. 11 \\nFood purchase shares of low- and middle-income \\nhouseholds are lower overall than the shares of \\nhigh-income households across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum ( Figure 25 ). The differences are small \\nin urban areas, but become much bigger in \\nperi-urban areas less than 1 hour from either a \\nlarge city or an intermediate city. This suggests \\nthat while these households still rely on food \\npurchases, own food production is also important \\n(Box\\xa05). The pattern holds for both high- and \\nlow-food-budget countries, although food \\npurchase shares are slightly lower for the latter. \\nIn urban and rural areas, the dispersion of \\nfood purchase shares across household income \\ngroups is smaller than in peri-urban areas, \\nindicating that household income is less of a \\nfactor driving food purchase shares for urban \\nand rural households. The only exception is \\npoor households in more remote rural areas \\n(more than 2\\xa0hours travel to a city or town), \\nwhose food purchase shares are 31\\xa0percent and \\n15\\xa0percent less than high-income households in \\nthe same areas of high- and low-food-budget \\ncountries, respectively. \\nThe descriptive analysis presented up until this \\npoint is backed up by an econometric analysis \\nthat looks into the determinants of food purchase \\nshares for the high- and low-food-budget \\ncountries. Determinants include location \\nacross the rural–urban continuum, household \\nincome, non-farm employment, food prices, x age, \\neducation, marital status and gender of the head \\nof the household, household size, and size of \\ncultivated land, ownership of assets and animal \\nstocks. Table\\xa0A7.1 in Annex\\xa07 presents the full \\neconometric results. Here we highlight some of \\nthe key findings from this analysis.\\nx While the focus is on non-price determinants, price variables are \\nadded as control variables to show the location effect across the rural–\\nurban continuum. As expected, the marginal effect of own prices is \\nstatistically significant.\\n»\\n| 78 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 108, 'page_label': '79'}, page_content=\"THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n FIGURE 25   THERE IS A MARKED DROP IN PURCHASED FOOD CONSUMPTION SHARES FOR LOW- AND \\nMIDDLE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN PERI-URBAN AREAS, WITH LEVELS SIMILAR TO RURAL \\nHOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH HIGH- AND LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nHigh income\\nMiddle income\\nLow income\\nPURCHASED FOOD CONSUMPTION SHARE  \\n(PERCENTAGE)\\nLarge city\\n(>1 million \\npeople)\\nIntermediate \\ncity\\n(0.25–1 million \\npeople)\\nSmall city \\n(50–250 \\nthousand \\npeople)\\nTown \\n(20–50 \\nthousand \\npeople)\\n<1 hour to\\na large city\\n<1 hour to an \\nintermediate \\ncity\\n<1 hour to \\na small city\\n<1 hour \\nto a town\\n1–2 hours \\nto a city\\nor town\\n>2 hours \\nto a city\\nor town\\n50% line\\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA)\\nLow-food-budget countries:\\nHigh-food-budget countries: Ethiopia Côte d'Ivoire MaliSenegal Nigeria\\nGuinea-Bissau Benin Togo Malawi NigerBurkina Faso\\nNOTES: The figure shows household food purchases as a percentage share of total household food consumption (at market value) across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum (URCA) by household income group, country, and high- and low-food-budget country group.

This \\ncan be interpreted as meaning that households \\n“start purchasing” at lower income levels in \\nhigh-food-budget countries; that is, the transition \\nof diets in the form of purchasing has spread \\nmore into lower-income households in that group \\nof countries. This coincides with the findings of \\nother studies. 12\\nIn both country food-budget groups, \\nfurthermore, more non-farm employment (and \\nhence non-farm income) leads to a higher food \\npurchase share. This was found reliably in all \\ncountry cases and when controlling for gender \\n(except Guinea-Bissau). Male rural non-farm \\nemployment shows a somewhat stronger effect in \\nlow-food-budget countries (for the reason noted \\nabove). The effect is present but less supported \\nfor female employment in both high- and \\nlow-food-budget countries. \\nAnother important result is that education \\nof the head of the household, particularly \\nsecondary schooling, even when controlling for \\nincome, is correlated with a higher household \\nfood purchase share. The result is particularly \\nstrong in high-food-budget countries. This \\nmay reflect a variety of factors such as greater \\nopportunity cost of time (for home production) \\nin the types of jobs held by the more educated. \\nIn\\xa0addition, when accounting for gender, there is \\na positive effect for female-headed households in \\nhigh-food-budget countries, excluding Malawi. \\nThis could again be linked to opportunity cost of \\ntime for women in these households to do both \\ntheir own farming and home processing of food, \\nversus buying food to free up time for home \\nchores and management. \\nFurthermore, results show that the larger the \\nhousehold size the lower the household food \\npurchases, in both high- and low-food-budget \\ncountries. This is presumably because having \\ntheir own labour allows households to substitute \\npurchased food with their own production, \\nfor example in processing and farming. This \\nis reinforced with the expected negative effect \\non food purchases of ownership of farmland \\nand animal stocks.\\nThere is a diffusion of processed foods \\nand food away from home across the \\nrural–urban continuum, but it is higher in \\nurban areas \\nIn all regions, there has been diffusion of \\npurchased processed foods, as well as food away \\nfrom home (e.g.\\xa0prepared food from vendors or \\nin restaurants), in urban and rural areas. Over \\ncenturies, small- and large-scale processing of \\nstaple foods (e.g. polished rice, wheat and maize \\nflour, edible oils) have introduced essential \\ntime- and energy-saving innovations, presenting \\nopportunities for nutritional enhancement such as \\nfood fortification. Food processing has continued \\nto grow, expanding to prepared foods, both at \\nsmall scale (often unpackaged and unbranded) \\nand at very large scale (packaged and branded). \\nWhile the diffusion of processed foods, including \\nhighly processed foods, is already advanced in \\nAsia 9 and Latin America, 13 it is spreading quickly \\nin Africa as well. 14\\nIncreasing numbers of women are working \\noutside the home in both urban and rural \\nareas, while men and women are increasingly \\ncommuting to work in urban areas and going \\nto off-farm jobs in rural areas. These factors \\nmay prompt a rise in purchases of prepared \\nfood from food service enterprises, due to \\nreduced time availability for home processing \\n(e.g.\\xa0hand-pounding grains) and food preparation. \\nThe dynamics of supply and demand for \\nprocessed foods, however, are complex. There has \\nbeen a surge on the supply side, with small and \\nmedium enterprises and large private companies \\nalike making massive aggregate investments in \\nall types of processed foods (from minimally to \\nhighly processed) in response to demand. 14\\xa0At the \\nsame time, aggressive marketing and relatively \\nlow pricing – and even interference in policies \\n»\\n| 82 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 112, 'page_label': '83'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nto curb consumption of highly processed foods \\nand sugar-sweetened beverages – are driving \\nup consumption. \\nThere is a critical role for minimally and low \\nprocessed foods as part of a healthy diet; in \\naddition, they are a major and growing source of \\nemployment across the rural–urban continuum \\n(see Chapter\\xa03).

Recent \\nstudies in Africa show that the expansion of \\nfood supply chains in the processing sector \\n(processing, wholesale, transport and retail) \\nprovides a major source of employment across the \\nrural–urban continuum, especially for women and \\nyouth. 12 Latest estimates indicate that 20\\xa0percent \\nof rural employment and 25\\xa0percent of urban \\nemployment are in agrifood systems jobs such as \\nwholesale and processing. 12 Unfortunately, few \\nof these studies provide sufficient disaggregation \\nof product portfolios to assess the balance of \\npotential benefits and harms to healthy diet goals.\\nExamining the household consumption of both \\nlow processed and highly processed foods and \\nfood away from home provides insights into \\nfood demand across the rural–urban continuum. \\nThe demand for processed foods of all types in \\nAfrica is expected to continue to rise over the \\nnext decades with urbanization, the continued \\nrise in rural non-farm employment and the \\nconcomitant effects on cost savings of food \\npreparation and thus demand for convenience \\nfoods. Increased commuting to work is also \\nraising the opportunity cost of time for both men \\nand women, with meals and snacks purchased \\nat roadside stalls, restaurants and market kiosks. \\nEvidence shows that this process has already been \\nseen in other developing regions. 15,\\xa016  \\nIn the analysis that follows, all food items \\nwere classified by level of food processing \\nbased on the four main groups in the NOV A \\nfood classification system. Unprocessed and \\nminimally processed foods (group\\xa01) were then \\nexcluded from the analyses in this section. \\nGroups\\xa02 and\\xa03 were combined as one group, \\nreferred to as “low processed” , and group\\xa04 was \\nmaintained as highly processed. See Annex\\xa05 for \\nan explanation and full description and sources \\nof the processing categories applied. In addition \\nto these two categories, food away from home \\nwas made a separate, single category, because \\nthere is insufficient information to identify \\nthe extent of processing for all items involved \\nand it is therefore not possible to accurately \\ncategorize such food. \\nThe diffusion of processed foods across the \\ncontinuum is similar and quite extensive for both \\nhigh- and low-food-budget countries ( Figure 26A). \\nThe exception to this is in areas less than 1 hour \\nfrom intermediate cities of low-food-budget \\ncountries, where the share is much lower if \\ncompared to the same catchment areas of \\nhigh-food-budget countries. On average, the share \\nof total processed foods and food away from \\nhome is 29\\xa0percent in high-food-budget countries, \\nand 25\\xa0percent in low-food-budget countries. \\nEven households living in rural areas 1\\xa0to 2\\xa0hours \\nor more from a city or town are consuming \\nprocessed foods and food away from home. \\nWhile the consumption of processed foods and \\nfood away from home is higher in cities and \\ntowns, in terms of consumed value shares, it\\xa0only \\ndeclines gradually moving into peri-urban areas; \\nhowever, there is a more abrupt drop in peri-urban \\nareas of intermediate cities in low-food-budget \\ncountries ( Figure 26A). Evidence of a smooth and \\ngradual diminishing share along the continuum \\ndispels the notion of a sharp rural–urban divide in \\nthe consumption of processed foods. \\nLooking at low processed and highly processed \\nfoods separately, we find that in both sets of \\ncountries, highly processed foods account \\nfor a small proportion of total consumption \\n(Figure 26B). However, the shares are slightly higher \\nin peri-urban areas of small cities and towns \\nand rural areas of low-food-budget countries \\ncompared to the same areas in high-food-budget \\ncountries. The shares of highly processed foods \\nare also found to be greater in urban areas \\nthan in rural areas, in both sets of countries. \\nThe results highlight the penetration of highly \\nprocessed foods into rural areas, even those \\nliving 1 to 2 hours or more from a city or town. »\\n| 83 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 113, 'page_label': '84'}, page_content='CHAPTER 4  THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>\\n FIGURE 26   IN THE 11 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, RURAL HOUSEHOLDS ARE CONSUMING PROCESSED \\nFOODS, INCLUDING HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS, EVEN THOSE LIVING 1 TO 2 HOURS OR MORE FROM  \\nA CITY OR TOWN\\nA) AVERAGE CONSUMPTION SHARES OF PROCESSED FOODS AND FOOD AWAY FROM HOME ACROSS\\nTHE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM FOR SELECTED HIGH- AND LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES IN AFRICA\\nB) COMPOSITION OF AVERAGE CONSUMPTION SHARES OF PROCESSED FOODS ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN \\nCONTINUUM FOR SELECTED HIGH- AND LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES IN AFRICA\\nLow processed foodsHigh-food-budget countries: Highly processed foods Food away from home\\nLow processed foodsLow-food-budget countries: Highly processed foods Food away from home\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n40\\n45\\nPURCHASED PROCESSED FOOD\\nCONSUMPTION SHARE (PERCENTAGE) \\nPURCHASED PROCESSED FOOD\\nCONSUMPTION SHARE (PERCENTAGE)\\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA)\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\nLow processed foods Highly processed foods Food away from home Low processed foods Highly processed foods Food away from home\\nHIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nURBAN PERI-URBAN RURAL\\nLarge city (>1 million people)\\nIntermediate city (0.25–1 million people)\\nSmall city (50–250 thousand people)\\nTown (20–50 thousand people)\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n<1 hour to an intermediate city\\n<1 hour to a small city\\n<1 hour to a town\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\nLarge city\\n(>1/uni00A0million\\npeople)\\nIntermediate\\ncity\\n(0.25–1 million\\npeople)\\nSmall city\\n(50–250\\nthousand\\npeople)\\nTown\\n(20–50\\nthousand\\npeople)\\n<1 hour\\nto an \\nintermediate\\ncity\\n<1 hour\\nto a small\\ncity\\n<1 hour\\nto a town\\n1–2 hours\\nto a city\\nor town\\n>2 hours\\nto a city\\nor town\\n<1 hour\\nto a large\\ncity\\nURBAN CENTRES PERI-URBAN AREAS RURAL AREAS\\nNOTES: The figures show household food consumption of processed foods (low and highly processed foods ) and food away from home as a percentage \\nshare of total household food consumption (at market value) across the rural–urban continuum (URCA).

On the other hand, \\nfood away from home is higher as a share of total \\nhousehold food consumption in high-food-budget \\ncountries ( Figure 27 ). This could suggest that there \\nis more off-farm employment in rural areas of \\nhigh-food-budget countries. This makes sense \\nas food away from home is correlated with \\nworking outside the home and commuting within \\ncities or from rural to urban areas or other rural \\nareas (see Chapter\\xa03 ). Such employment patterns \\nemerge with development and urbanization, both \\ncorrelated with high-food-budget countries.\\nAs was done for food purchases, an econometric \\nanalysis was undertaken to look into the \\ndeterminants (i.e.\\xa0location effect of each URCA, \\nhousehold income, non-farm employment, etc.) \\nof the share of purchases of highly processed \\nfoods as a value share of total household food \\nconsumption. Table A7.2 in Annex\\xa07 presents the \\nstatistically significant results, of which the key \\npoints are highlighted below. \\nHolding other factors constant, the effects of \\nlocation across the rural–urban continuum \\ncorroborate the descriptive findings: the farther \\nfrom a large city, the smaller the share of \\nhighly processed foods in total household food \\nconsumption for high-food-budget countries, \\nexcept for more remote areas in low-food-budget \\ncountries. The finding on the location effect is \\nsimilar to that observed for the United Republic \\nof Tanzania (not included in this analysis), \\naccording to a study using detailed household \\nbudget survey data with urban, peri-urban and \\nrural gradations. 17 It is also similar to findings for \\nrural and urban areas in Bangladesh, Indonesia, \\nNepal and Viet Nam. 9\\nThe pure effect of income is associated with a \\nhigher share of highly processed foods in both \\ncountry food-budget groups, but with a greater \\nimpact in low-food-budget countries ( Table\\xa0A7.2 in \\nAnnex\\xa07). This corroborates findings from other \\nrecent studies in Africa, for example in Uganda \\nand the United Republic of Tanzania. 17 In both \\nhigh- and low-food-budget countries, more \\nnon-farm employment leads to a higher share of \\nhighly processed foods in total household food \\nconsumption. This finding is particularly true \\nfor male non-farm employment, as the effect is \\nfound to be statistically significant in 8\\xa0out of \\nthe 11\\xa0countries analysed. The effect for female \\nnon-farm employment is similar to that for male \\nnon-farm employment in high-food-budget \\ncountries, but is not statistically significant in \\nlow-food-budget countries. \\nAll other things equal, the primary schooling of \\nthe household head is significantly correlated \\nwith a greater consumption value share of highly \\nprocessed foods in only three countries, while the \\nhousehold head being female is correlated with a \\ngreater share in most high-food-budget countries, \\nexcept for a dampening effect in Ethiopia ( Table\\xa0A7.2 \\nin Annex\\xa07 ). In the former, this is supported by \\nother studies showing that women substitute \\nprocessed foods for meal preparation to free up \\ntime for other household chores, as well as off-farm \\nwork.14 But in poorer countries, it could be that \\nwomen managing the household alone have less \\ntime (and therefore less access) to buy these foods. \\nHowever, these results require further exploration. \\nFinally, larger households have a lower share of \\nhighly processed food purchases in some of the \\nhigh-food-budget countries, whereas the effect is \\nmixed in low-food-budget countries ( Table\\xa0A7.2 in \\nAnnex\\xa07 ). The higher the dependency ratio y in both \\ncountry food-budget groups, the higher the share \\nof highly processed foods purchased. \\nHousehold food consumption by various \\nfood groups varies over the rural–urban \\ncontinuum, driven by patterns of \\nurbanization, income and non-farm \\nemployment \\nUrbanization is implicitly associated with shifts \\nin household food consumption, in which urban \\nhouseholds purchase a more varied diet, one that \\nis less dominated by staple foods and comprises \\na larger variety of foods from other food groups, \\nincluding more expensive foods such as meat \\nand dairy (see Chapter\\xa03 ). However, some studies \\nsuggest that it is higher income in urban areas, \\nrather than urbanization per se, that is causing \\nthese shifts. 18 This section provides further \\nanalysis of these issues. \\ny Dependency ratio takes into account the consumption needs of \\nyoung and elderly people, and the productivity of middle-aged people.\\n| 86 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 116, 'page_label': '87'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nAll food items are categorized into eight food \\ngroups: i) staple foods including cereals, roots, \\ntubers, plantains and their products; ii) pulses, \\nseeds, nuts and their products; iii) animal source \\nfoods including milk, eggs, meat, fish, shellfish, \\ninsects/grubs and all their products; iv) vegetables \\nand their products; v) fruits and their products; vi) \\nfats and oils; vii) sweets, condiments and beverages; \\nand viii) meals eaten outside the home (food away \\nfrom home). See Table\\xa0A5.6  in Annex\\xa05 for definitions \\nof food group aggregates. Given the number of food \\ngroups to be analysed, the ten URCA categories are \\nfurther aggregated into three categories – urban, \\nperi-urban and rural – to facilitate the presentation \\nof some figures (see Table 9). \\nLooking at household food composition in terms \\nof the value shares of food consumption by food \\ngroup, a diet transition is clearly occurring across \\nthe rural–urban continuum ( Table 11). This involves \\na diversification of diets at the household level, \\nincluding the consumption of more expensive \\nfood items, like animal source foods and fruits. \\nThis suggests the transition is also occurring in \\nrural areas, though lagged and to a lesser extent \\nthan in urban and peri-urban areas. \\nInterestingly, in this small group of countries in \\nAfrica, there are no major differences between \\nhigh- and low-food-budget countries. This might \\nsuggest a convergence in the diet transition \\noccurring across the set of countries. The finding \\nthat consumption value shares of non-staple foods \\nare similar in the two food-budget groups is \\nsomewhat paradoxical. This could be because in \\nboth sets of countries, low-cost non-staple foods \\n– such as vegetables or pulses – are accessible \\nand also desired by households. Another study \\nin Senegal 19 found that household expenditure \\nshares were similar in urban and rural areas, but \\nthe absolute levels of expenditure were lower \\nin rural areas and among the poor. This may \\nbe similar to saying that low-cost pulses figure \\nlargely in the diets of the poor. The findings \\ndo not negate Bennett’s law, z but make its \\nslope more gradual. \\nz  In agricultural economics and development economics, Bennett’s \\nlaw observes that as incomes rise, people eat relatively fewer calorie-\\ndense starchy staple foods and relatively more nutrient-dense meats, \\noils, sweeteners, fruits and vegetables. 8 \\nStaple foods as a share of household food \\nconsumption in value terms are on average \\n30\\xa0percent (high-food-budget countries) and \\n28\\xa0percent (low-food-budget countries) in urban \\nareas ( Figure 28). Note that this share is just slightly \\nabove the share of 25 percent in Asian cities. 9 \\nConsumption value shares of staple foods, \\nincluding market-valued own-produced staple \\nfoods, are similar in peri-urban and rural areas, \\nbut roughly 12\\xa0percentage points higher than in \\nurban areas. The average share of staple foods \\nin total houseold food consumption is similar in \\nhigh- and low-food-budget countries: 41\\xa0percent \\nand 40\\xa0percent (respectively) in peri-urban areas, \\nand 42\\xa0percent and 43\\xa0percent (respectively) \\nin rural areas. \\nAs expected, following Bennett’s law, as \\nhousehold income rises the share of staple \\nfoods in total household food consumption falls \\n(Figure 28). This holds true across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum, whether looking at urban, peri-urban \\nor rural aggregate categories (as shown in \\nFigure 28) or at more disaggregated URCA \\ncategories (not shown). \\nOverall, the value shares of staple foods comprise \\na minority of total household food consumption, \\nnot only in urban areas but across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum. It is striking that the diversification \\nof household food consumption, which is the \\ninverse of dependence on staple foods, is similar \\nin urban areas of both country food-budget \\ngroups. Furthermore, the ratio of the shares \\nof staple foods in rural areas to urban areas is \\nnearly the same in high- and low-food-budget \\ncountries (1.4 and 1.5, respectively), suggesting an \\nintercountry convergence.\\nThe smaller staple food shares in urban areas are \\ngenerally offset by larger shares of animal source \\nfoods and food away from home ( Figure \\xa029A). \\nThis is expected, as urbanization is generally \\nassociated with urban households procuring \\nmore varied foods, including more expensive \\nfoods such as meat, but also eating outside\\xa0the \\nhome more often.

For example, the determinants \\nof consumption of animal source foods and food \\naway from home corroborate the descriptive trends. \\nIncreases in the share of consumption of animal \\nsource foods in household food consumption are \\nmainly driven by statistically significant increases \\nin income (see Table\\xa0A7.3 in Annex\\xa07 ). \\nFor the shares of food away from home, the \\neffect of income is mixed across high- and \\nlow-food-budget countries, but it shows an \\naverage higher consumption share as income \\nincreases when all countries are pulled \\ntogether ( Table\\xa0A7.4 in Annex\\xa07 ). However, in \\nboth country food-budget groups, more male \\nnon-farm employment leads to a higher share \\nof food away from home and the effect is \\nhigher in high-food-budget countries than in \\nlow-food-budget countries. This\\xa0may reflect \\nemployment that is more spatially dispersed, with \\nlonger commutes, and thus a greater need for food \\naway from home. It may also be the case that in \\nsome high-food-budget countries, restaurants and \\nvendors (i.e.\\xa0food services) that prepare meals (for \\nfood away from home) are more plentiful. \\nThe location effect across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum is present and statistically significant \\nin low-food-budget countries. In this case, the \\nconsumption value share of food away from \\nhome is much greater in large cities than in \\ntowns, but decreases incrementally in peri-urban \\nareas the larger the size of the closest city, and \\ndecreases moving from towns to rural areas, \\nwith the largest decrease occurring in areas 1 \\nto 2\\xa0hours from any urban centre. The location \\neffect is statistically significant for fewer URCA \\ncategories in high-food-budget countries. It shows \\na greater consumption of food away from home in \\nlarge and intermediate cities compared to towns, \\nand a decrease in rural areas, with the largest \\ndrop occurring in areas more than 2\\xa0hours from \\nany urban centre. These results corroborate the \\ndescriptive findings: the larger the urban city, \\nthe higher the share of food away from home \\nin total consumption; the greater the distance \\nfrom a large city, the smaller the share ( Table\\xa0A7.4 \\nin Annex\\xa07). The consumption of food away from \\nhome is often linked to commuting for work; \\ntherefore these patterns reflect how much farther \\nworkers have to commute from home in cities \\ncompared to rural areas. \\nIn contrast to animal \\nsource foods and food \\naway from home, \\nthe analysis of the \\ndeterminants of the \\nshare of vegetables in \\ntotal household food \\nconsumption suggests \\nthat this consumption \\nis driven more by \\naccess and availability than by income. The effect \\nof income on vegetable consumption is mixed, \\nbut overall negative and statistically significant, \\nindicating a reduction in vegetable consumption \\nshares as income increases ( Table\\xa0A7.5 in Annex\\xa07 ). \\nOn the other hand, considering all countries \\ntogether, there are statistically significant \\nlocation effects on the share of vegetables in \\ntotal household food consumption across the \\nrural–urban continuum – after controlling \\nfor income. Large, intermediate and small \\ncities and areas less than 1 hour from large \\nand intermediate cities have higher shares of \\nvegetable consumption than do towns ( Table\\xa0A7.5 in \\nAnnex\\xa07). For low-food-budget countries, there is \\nalso a notable decrease in the share of vegetable \\nconsumption in rural areas. These findings \\nmay reflect the presence of major horticultural \\ncommercial zones near cities, or in well-watered \\nareas near highways and rivers, in both low- and \\nhigh-food-budget countries. \\nIn both high- and low-food-budget countries, \\nthe effect of non-farm employment is mostly \\nnon-significant ( Table\\xa0A7.5 in Annex\\xa07 ). However, \\nif\\xa0the household is headed by a woman, there \\nis a positive effect on the share of vegetable \\nconsumption in both country food-budget \\ngroups. Since the effect of income is taken into \\nconsideration at the same time, this can be \\ninterpreted as an indication that female diet \\nchoices for households make a difference, as \\nwomen, for example, choose food with greater \\nnutrient and vitamin content. n\\nFor household consumption, \\nshares of animal source \\nfoods are driven by income, \\nwhile shares of fruits and \\nvegetables are determined by \\naccess and availability.\\n»\\n| 91 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 121, 'page_label': '92'}, page_content='CHAPTER 4  THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>\\n4.2\\nCOST AND AFFORDABILITY \\nOF A HEALTHY DIET, \\nAND FOOD SECURITY \\nAND NUTRITION ACROSS \\nTHE RURAL–URBAN \\nCONTINUUM\\n KEY MESSAGES \\nè In the 11 African countries analysed, the cost of a \\nhealthy diet in urban areas is much higher (on average \\n1.2\\xa0times higher) than in peri-urban areas, and it \\nthen decreases the smaller the city size and moving \\ncloser to rural areas. This trend is less pronounced in \\nhigh-food-budget countries, which show similar costs \\nacross all urban areas.\\nè The higher cost of animal source foods, compared \\nto the other food groups, drives up the cost of a healthy \\ndiet across the rural–urban continuum, especially in \\nurban areas and remote rural areas. \\nè The lower cost of a healthy diet in peri-urban areas \\nof the 11 countries analysed compared to urban areas \\ndoes not translate into more affordable healthy diets, as \\nincome levels are a considerable factor. The percentage \\nof the population unable to afford a healthy diet in \\nperi-urban areas is higher than in urban areas and \\nsimilar to rural areas. \\nè In the 11 countries in Africa, the cost of a healthy \\ndiet exceeds average food expenditure for low- \\nand middle-income households in both high- and \\nlow-food-budget countries. Low-income households \\nliving in peri-urban and rural areas are especially \\ndisadvantaged, as they would need to more than \\ndouble what they currently spend on food to secure a \\nhealthy diet. \\nè In many of these African countries studied, the \\nprevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in \\nurban and peri-urban areas is similar to that in rural \\nareas, and in some cases, slightly higher, indicating that \\nfood insecurity is not exclusively a rural problem in most \\nof the countries analysed.\\nè In the three countries analysed in Africa, the \\nprevalence of child stunting generally increases \\nas cities become smaller and as one moves away \\nfrom urban centres. Child wasting and overweight \\nare lower and exhibit less evident trends across \\nthe\\xa0rural–urban continuum.\\nBased on the latest estimates ( Chapter\\xa02), we are \\nnot on track to end all forms of malnutrition by \\n2030. For instance, still 148.1\\xa0million children \\nunder five years of age were stunted in 2022, \\nwhile 45\\xa0million were wasted and 37\\xa0million \\nwere overweight. According to the Global \\nBurden of Disease Study, in 2019 dietary risk \\nwas the second largest Level\\xa02 risk factor aa for \\nattributable deaths among females and the \\nthird among males. 20 \\nAll forms of malnutrition have multiple \\ncauses, but healthy diets can help reduce the \\nrisk of malnutrition in all its forms, including \\nmicronutrient deficiency, stunting, wasting, \\noverweight and obesity, as well as diet-related \\nNCDs. 21 The determinants of consumption \\nof healthy diets are similarly highly complex \\nand include behavioural and cultural factors, \\nfood placement and promotion within the food \\nenvironment. It is clear, however, that to ensure \\naccess to healthy diets, nutritious foods must \\nbe both available and affordable. Availability \\nrefers to the existence of food coming from \\neither own production or the market, while \\naffordability refers to people’s financial capacity \\nto acquire sufficient food, which in turn depends \\non household income and food prices. Low \\nincomes constrain how much food households \\ncan economically access, but relative prices \\nand systematic food price dispersion ab will \\ngreatly influence the types of foods selected \\nand, as a result, may influence diet-related \\nnutrition outcomes. 22\\naa The Global Burden of Disease Study 20 estimates the prevalence of \\nexposure and attributable deaths for, among others, 23\\xa0age groups; \\nmales, females, and both sexes combined; and 204 countries and \\nterritories.

Level\\xa01 risk factors are behavioural, environmental and \\noccupational, and metabolic; Level\\xa02 comprises 20 risk factors or \\nclusters of risks; Level\\xa03 comprises 52 risk factors or clusters of risks; \\nand Level\\xa04 comprises 69 specific risk factors.\\nab Food price dispersion emerges when the same kind of foods are \\nsold at different prices by stores in the same market.\\n| 92 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 122, 'page_label': '93'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nIt is worth recalling that the affordability \\nindicator is a measure of economic access. It \\nmeasures not the number of people not eating a \\nhealthy diet, but rather the number who do not \\nhave enough resources to acquire a healthy diet. \\nAs such, the contribution of social protection \\nprogrammes such as school feeding programmes \\nare not taken into consideration. On the other \\nhand, social programmes such as cash-based \\ntransfers, whether in-kind or monetary, or food \\ndonation programmes, are considered part of the \\nhousehold income.\\nThe 2020 edition of this report showed the \\nexistence of within-country variations in the \\ncost and affordability of a healthy diet, but it \\ndid not cover variations across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum. Studies suggest that urbanization \\nmay directly exert upward pressure on food \\nprices in poor countries. 18 This is because most \\nhouseholds now depend on food supplied by \\nmarkets rather than their own production. \\nThis is particularly true in urban areas where \\n– as shown in Figure 24  in Section\\xa04.1 – food \\npurchases constitute more than 78\\xa0percent of \\nhousehold consumption in the 11 sub-Saharan \\nAfrican countries analysed.

The analysis \\nrelies on the geospatial URCA dataset (see Box 2 \\nand Box\\xa03 in Chapter 3 , and Annex 4 , Section A); \\nwhile there is no comparable global dataset to \\nsupport the analysis, there are microlevel national \\nsurvey data that, once merged with the URCA \\ndataset, could provide insights on differences \\nacross the rural–urban continuum. The analysis \\nfocuses on the 11 sub-Saharan countries covered \\nin Section\\xa04.1, using the same household survey \\ndata (see Table\\xa0A5.1 in Annex\\xa05 ), and still grouping \\nthem into high-food-budget countries (2.3 PPP \\ndollars per capita per day) and low-food-budget \\ncountries (1.6 PPP dollars per capita per day) \\n(see Table 10 for the list of countries by category). \\nSimilar to Section\\xa04.1 , patterns, differences and \\nsimilarities are also analysed across ten URCA \\ncategories of the rural–urban continuum, as well \\nas a further aggregation into urban, peri-urban \\nand rural categories (see Table 9 and Annex\\xa05 , \\nSection B for further details).\\nCost and affordability of a healthy diet \\nacross the rural–urban continuum\\nThe calculation of subnational cost and \\naffordability of a healthy diet follows the same \\nmethodology as the global monitoring CoAHD \\nindicators presented in Chapter\\xa02 . However, \\nnational estimates derived from the aggregation \\nof subnational indicators are not comparable \\nwith global CoAHD indicators due to differences \\nin data sources. For further information and \\nthe full description of the data sources and \\nmethodology, see Annex\\xa08 . \\nCost of a healthy diet \\nAcross the 11 African countries analysed, the cost \\nof a healthy diet in urban centres is much higher \\n(on average 1.2\\xa0times higher) than in peri-urban \\nareas and it then decreases the smaller the city \\nsize and moving closer to rural areas. The higher \\ncost of a healthy diet in urban centres in almost \\nall countries analysed may be associated with the \\nwidespread diffusion of supermarkets in cities. \\nWhile diffusion of supermarkets may increase \\naccess to a more diverse diet (see Chapter\\xa03 ), \\nit may also push the cost of a healthy diet up, \\nmaking it less affordable for poorer households \\nin urban centres.\\nHowever, there are exceptions to this cost \\npattern. For example, in Guinea-Bissau, the \\ncost in peri-urban areas is slightly higher than \\nin urban areas. This is likely attributed to the \\nunique geographic concentration of cities in \\nthe south around the port of Bissau and to poor \\ninfrastructure, particularly in ferry and road \\ntransport systems linking urban and peri-urban \\nareas that are 1\\xa0hour away or less ( Figure\\xa0A6.1D  \\nin Annex\\xa06).23 In Ethiopia and Togo, the other \\nexceptions, the cost is higher in rural areas \\nthan in peri-urban areas; this is directly related \\nto the dispersed urbanization pattern in these \\ncountries (see Figure\\xa0A6.1C  in Annex\\xa06 ), with poor \\nrural areas inadequately connected to urban areas \\ndue to poor and limited road infrastructure. 24 \\n| 93 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 123, 'page_label': '94'}, page_content='CHAPTER 4  THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>\\nGenerally, in these three exceptional cases, \\npoor transport infrastructure is a major factor \\nhampering availability of nutritious foods (often \\nhighly perishable) and pushing up their cost \\nin rural areas. \\nAverage values across countries also hide \\ndifferences between high- and low-food-budget \\ncountries as shown in Figur e 30A. The cost of a \\nhealthy diet in high-food-budget countries is \\n23\\xa0percent – 22\\xa0percent\\xa0and 28\\xa0percent higher \\nthan in low-food-budget countries, comparing \\nurban, peri-urban and rural areas. The higher \\ncost in high-food-budget countries is mainly \\ndue to the higher cost of vegetables and animal \\nsource foods (29\\xa0percent and 32\\xa0percent higher \\nthan in low-food-budget countries, respectively). \\nFor both country food-budget groups, the largest \\ndecrease in the cost occurs moving from urban to \\nperi-urban areas, while in rural areas the cost is \\nsimilar to (in high-food-budget countries) or only \\nslightly lower than (in low-food-budget countries) \\nthat in peri-urban areas. \\nA more disaggregated view of the rural–urban \\ncontinuum (i.e.\\xa0considering the ten URCA \\ncategories) reveals a much closer convergence \\nin the cost of a healthy diet in high-food-budget \\ncountries, particularly in urban areas ( Figure  30B). \\nOn the other hand, the range in the cost is wider \\nfor low-food-budget countries. The greater \\nconvergence in the cost of a healthy diet in \\nhigh-food-budget countries points to their \\nbetter connectivity in food supply chains \\nacross the rural–urban continuum compared to \\nlow-food-budget countries. \\nLooking at the cost pattern across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum for individual countries also provides \\nfurther insights ( Table\\xa0A9.2 in Annex\\xa09 ). For example, \\nin Benin and Togo, households living in urban \\ncentres face a cost, respectively, 1.4\\xa0and 1.7\\xa0times \\nhigher than households living in peri-urban areas \\n– and most of the population of these countries is \\nconcentrated in peri-urban areas of small cities. \\nThis suggests that a more dispersed urbanization \\npattern, likely involving decentralized markets \\nserved by local producers, may significantly drive \\nthe cost of healthy diets down.\\nFinally, and differently from that seen for \\nlow-food-budget countries, the cost of a healthy \\ndiet basket is particularly high in very remote \\nrural areas, more than 2 hours from any urban \\ncentre in high-food-budget countries ( Table\\xa0A9.2 in \\nAnnex\\xa09). Among the high-food budget countries, \\nthe cost difference between these remote areas \\nand rural areas 1 to 2\\xa0hours from any urban centre \\nis particularly high in Nigeria. This may be a \\nreflection of the different urbanization patterns \\nin those countries, which have undergone a \\nmetropolitan expansion process with most of the \\npopulation living in large and/or intermediate cities \\nand in peri-urban areas 1\\xa0hour away or less. In \\nthis situation, a more abrupt separation from more \\nremote rural areas can be expected, with disruption \\nin the food supply chain and higher prices.\\nThe cost structure by food group of a healthy \\ndiet does not present any striking differences \\nacross URCAs, with each of the six food groups \\ncontributing to the total cost of a healthy diet \\nin about the same percentage, independently \\nof the catchment area for both high- and \\nlow-food-budget countries ( Figure\\xa0A9.1  in Annex\\xa09 ). \\nThe largest cost contribution by food group \\nto a healthy diet comes from animal source \\nfoods (31–41\\xa0percent), followed by vegetables \\n(17–22\\xa0percent), staple foods (16–21\\xa0percent), fruits \\n(10–18\\xa0percent), fats and oils (6–8\\xa0percent), and \\npulses, seeds and nuts (6–8\\xa0percent). \\nHowever, it is worth noting the higher cost share \\nof animal source foods in all urban centres and \\nperi-urban areas of high-food-budget countries, \\ncompared to low-food-budget countries (between \\n2\\xa0and 6\\xa0percentage points difference) ( Figure\\xa0A9.1  \\nin Annex\\xa09). The largest cost difference is found \\nin towns, where households in high-food-budget \\ncountries spend USD\\xa00.29 more per person per \\nday on animal source foods than do households \\nin low-food-budget countries ( Figure 31).\\nThe other trend to highlight is the higher cost \\ncontribution of animal source foods compared to \\nall other food groups, even vegetables and fruits \\ncombined, in almost all URCAs in both country \\nfood-budget groups. The main outliers are large \\ncities of low-food-budget countries, due to the \\nhigher share of fruits in the cost of a healthy diet \\n(Figure\\xa0A 9.1 in Annex\\xa09 ).\\nFinally, the cost contribution of animal source \\nfoods in the total cost of a healthy diet (both as »\\n| 94 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 124, 'page_label': '95'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n FIGURE 30   IN THE 11 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, THE COST OF A HEALTHY DIET IN URBAN AREAS IS MUCH \\nHIGHER THAN IN PERI-URBAN AREAS, AND IT DECREASES THE SMALLER THE CITY SIZE AND MOVING \\nCLOSER TO RURAL AREAS; THIS TREND IS LESS PRONOUNCED IN HIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES,  \\nWHICH SHOW SIMILAR COSTS ACROSS ALL URBAN AREAS\\nUrban Peri-urban Rural Urban Peri-urban Rural\\nHIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\n0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\nCOST OF A HEALTHY DIET\\n(PPP DOLLARS PER PERSON PER DAY) \\nA) COST OF A HEALTHY DIET IN URBAN, PERI-URBAN AND RURAL AREAS (URCA)\\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA)\\nHIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nLarge city\\n(>1/uni00A0million people)\\nIntermediate city\\n(0.25–1 million people)\\nSmall city\\n(50–250 thousand people)\\nTown\\n(20–50 thousand people)\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n<1 hour to\\nan intermediate/uni00A0city\\n<1 hour to a small city\\n<1 hour to a town\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n<1 hour to\\nan intermediate/uni00A0city\\n<1 hour to a small city\\n<1 hour to a town\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\nLarge city\\n(>1/uni00A0million people)\\nIntermediate city\\n(0.25–1 million people)\\nSmall city\\n(50–250 thousand people)\\nTown\\n(20–50 thousand people)\\nCOST OF A HEALTHY DIET\\n(PPP DOLLARS PER PERSON PER DAY) \\n0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\nB) COST OF A HEALTHY DIET ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA)\\nLOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nNOTES: Figure\\xa0A shows the cost of a healthy diet in urban, peri-urban and rural areas (URCA).

On the other hand, it is lower in \\nperi-urban areas of intermediate and small cities, \\nas well as in areas 1 to 2\\xa0hours from a city of any \\nsize ( Figure 31 and Figure\\xa0A 9.1 in Annex\\xa09 ).\\nThe lower cost of animal source foods in \\nperi-urban areas, coupled with the high cost of \\nfruits and vegetables in large cities, particularly in \\nlow-food-budget countries, explains the decrease \\nin the overall cost of a healthy diet basket from \\nurban to rural areas across the continuum \\n(Figure 31). The lower cost of fruits, vegetables and \\nanimal source foods in the outskirts of cities is \\nclearly a consequence of the proximity to the \\nproduction site of these perishable products. In \\nfact, the increasing demand for animal source \\nfoods from better-off urban dwellers is attracting \\nmore medium- and large-scale livestock operators \\nto urban and peri-urban areas (such operators \\nhad moved farther away when urbanization first \\nbegan to intensify). 25 Furthermore, the wider \\ncost difference for animal source foods across \\nthe rural–urban continuum of low-food-budget \\ncountries is likely due to the higher constraints in \\nthe cold supply chain.\\nCost of a healthy diet compared to actual household \\nfood expenditure\\nThe food demand analysis in Section\\xa04.1  \\nshows the patterns of food consumption across \\nthe rural–urban continuum, including the \\nmarket value of the foods consumed by food \\ngroup. From this analysis, however, it is not \\npossible to determine whether the consumed \\ndiet provides the quantity of calories and \\nnutrients, and the diverse intake of foods from \\ndifferent food groups that would constitute a \\nhealthy diet. This would require a different set \\nof data and information, which is not available. \\nOn the other hand, it is possible to compare \\nthe cost of a healthy diet to what households \\nare actually spending on food (including \\nmarket value of own food production), in \\norder to determine whether they would have \\nto spend more or less of the income they have \\navailable to secure a healthy diet. This is a \\nuseful comparison, especially as estimates \\ncan be disaggregated by URCA category and \\nhousehold income level. \\nOn average at the national level, the cost of a \\nhealthy diet is lower than the amount households \\nspend on food in the high-food-budget \\ncountries analysed (see Table\\xa0A9.1 in Annex\\xa09 ). For \\nhigh-food-budget countries, the cost of a healthy \\ndiet is 86\\xa0percent of average food consumption, \\nvarying from 74\\xa0percent to 97\\xa0percent among \\nthe countries in this group. For low-food-budget \\ncountries, there is more variability. In two \\ncountries (Burkina Faso and the Niger), the cost \\nof a healthy diet is almost 40\\xa0percent greater \\nthan average food consumption. However, in the \\nothers, the cost of a healthy diet is lower than the \\nactual amount spent on food.\\nThe national averages, however, obscure the fact \\nthat for low- and middle-income households in \\nboth country food-budget groups, the cost of a \\nhealthy diet actually exceeds average expenditure \\non food ( Figure 32A). For low-income households, \\nthe cost of a healthy diet basket is about twice \\nthe amount that households spend on food: \\nspecifically, 2.3\\xa0times higher in low-food-budget \\ncountries and 2\\xa0times higher in high-food-budget \\ncountries. Middle-income households would \\nalso need to increase current spending to have \\naccess to a healthy diet (i.e.\\xa0by 34\\xa0percent in \\nlow-food-budget countries and 17\\xa0percent in \\nhigh-food-budget countries). \\nThis problem is seen for all low- and \\nmiddle-income households in both high- and \\nlow-food-budget countries across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum, although it becomes particularly acute \\nmoving from urban to peri-urban areas ( Figure 32B). \\nLow-income households living in peri-urban \\nand rural areas are especially disadvantaged, as \\nthey would need to more than double what they \\ncurrently spend on food to secure a healthy diet. \\nAffordability of a healthy diet across the \\nrural–urban continuum\\nAffordability, or the cost of a healthy diet \\nrelative to income that households can credibly \\nreserve for food, reflects the ability to access a \\nhealthy diet. Tracing this affordability across \\neach URCA in the 11 countries analysed shows \\nhow economic access to a healthy diet follows \\ndifferent paths in countries with different \\nlevels of development and urbanization. \\nImportantly, high costs do not necessarily \\ntranslate into greater unaffordability, and vice \\n»\\n»\\n| 96 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 126, 'page_label': '97'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n FIGURE 31   IN THE 11 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, THE HIGHER COST OF ANIMAL SOURCE FOODS DRIVES  \\nTHE HIGH COST OF A HEALTHY DIET ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM, ESPECIALLY IN URBAN \\nAND REMOTE RURAL AREAS\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.9\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.9\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.9\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.9\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.8\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.7\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.6\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.8\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.6\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.3\\n0.9\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\nAVERAGE COST OF EACH FOOD GROUP IN A HEALTHY DIET \\n(PPP DOLLARS PER PERSON PER DAY)\\nA) AVERAGE COST OF EACH FOOD GROUP IN A HEALTHY DIET ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM \\nIN HIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nB) AVERAGE COST OF EACH FOOD GROUP IN A HEALTHY DIET ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM \\nIN LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\n0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\nAVERAGE COST OF EACH FOOD GROUP IN A HEALTHY DIET \\n(PPP DOLLARS PER PERSON PER DAY)\\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA)\\nRURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA)\\nStaple foods Vegetables Pulses, seeds and nutsFruits Fats and oilsAnimal source foods\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.7\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.7\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.6\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.6\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.6\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.5\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.5\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.7\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.5\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.7\\n0.1\\n0.1\\nLarge city\\n(>1 million \\npeople)\\nIntermediate \\ncity\\n(0.25–1 million \\npeople)\\nSmall city \\n(50–250 \\nthousand \\npeople)\\nTown\\n(20–50 \\nthousand \\npeople)\\n<1 hour to\\na large city\\n<1 hour to an \\nintermediate \\ncity\\n<1 hour \\nto a small \\ncity\\n<1 hour \\nto a town\\n1–2 hours \\nto a city\\nor town\\n>2 hours \\nto a city\\nor town\\nLarge city\\n(>1 million \\npeople)\\nIntermediate \\ncity\\n(0.25–1 million \\npeople)\\nSmall city \\n(50–250 \\nthousand \\npeople)\\nTown\\n(20–50 \\nthousand \\npeople)\\n<1 hour to\\na large city\\n<1 hour to an \\nintermediate \\ncity\\n<1 hour \\nto a small \\ncity\\n<1 hour \\nto a town\\n1–2 hours \\nto a city\\nor town\\n>2 hours \\nto a city\\nor town\\n2.5\\nNOTES: The figures show the average cost of each food group in a healthy diet across the rural–urban continuum (URCA), for high-food-budget ( Figure\\xa0A ) \\nand low-food-budget ( Figure\\xa0B ) countries.

Finally, in high-food-budget \\ncountries, the percentage of the population \\nunable to afford a healthy diet increases across \\nperi-urban areas as the size of the closest urban \\ncentre decreases ( Figure 33 ).\\nFood insecurity across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum\\nThe comparison of food insecurity among \\nrural, peri-urban and urban populations at the \\nglobal and regional levels based on the Degree \\nof Urbanization (DEGURBA) classification, ac \\npresented in Chapter\\xa02 , indicates that food \\ninsecurity is lower in urban areas at the global \\nlevel.

This suggests that food insecurity is \\nnot exclusively a rural problem in most of the \\ncountries analysed. \\nThe FIES analysis shows a different pattern \\nacross the rural–urban continuum in high- \\nand low-food-budget countries. In general, \\nlow-food-budget countries show larger differences \\nand varying patterns in food insecurity ( Figure 3 4A). \\nIn Malawi, moderate or severe food insecurity \\nis much lower in urban areas and increases \\nsignificantly moving to peri-urban and rural \\nareas, with extremely high levels of severe food \\ninsecurity in both areas. Moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity in urban and peri-urban areas is about \\nthe same in Benin, but in Burkina Faso it is higher \\nin urban areas than in peri-urban areas. Only \\nin Guinea-Bissau and Togo is there a gradual \\nincrease moving from urban to rural areas. \\nIn contrast, in high-food-budget countries, the \\nprevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity \\nis about the same across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum ( Figure 3 4A). In the case of Nigeria, there \\nis some indication that moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity may be highest in peri-urban areas and \\nlowest in rural areas ( Figure 34A).\\nFurther disaggregation reveals some additional \\ndifferences. However, the sample sizes in each \\ncategory are small and the margins of error \\nare very large, so the observed patterns must \\nbe interpreted with caution (see the full set of \\nresults in Table\\xa0A10.1 and Table\\xa0A10.2 in Annex\\xa010 ). \\nFor example, in Nigeria, a high-food-budget \\ncountry, the prevalence of food insecurity is \\npositively associated with city size: the bigger \\nthe city, the higher the prevalence of food \\ninsecurity ( Figure 34 B). Moreover, levels of severe \\nfood insecurity in large and intermediate \\ncities (15\\xa0percent and 14\\xa0percent, respectively) \\nare even higher than in more remote areas \\n(10\\xa0percent in areas more than 2\\xa0hours travel \\nto any urban centre). This is likely related to \\nthe presence of slums outside the larger cities. \\nA similar pattern is also observed in Burkina \\nFaso, a low-food-budget country with a more \\ndispersed urbanization pattern. \\nIn the Niger, the pattern is reversed: the \\nprevalence of moderate or severe food »\\n| 100 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 130, 'page_label': '101'}, page_content=\"THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n FIGURE 34   IN MANY OF THE NINE COUNTRIES ANALYSED IN AFRICA, THE PREVALENCE OF MODERATE OR \\nSEVERE FOOD INSECURITY IN URBAN AND PERI-URBAN AREAS IS SIMILAR TO THAT IN RURAL AREAS, AND IN \\nSOME CASES, SLIGHTLY HIGHER, INDICATING THAT FOOD INSECURITY IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY A RURAL \\nPROBLEM IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES ANALYSED\\nA) PREVALENCE OF MODERATE OR SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY IN URBAN, PERI-URBAN AND RURAL AREAS (URCA) \\nBY HIGH- AND LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nB) PREVALENCE OF MODERATE OR SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM (URCA) \\nFOR SELECTED COUNTRIES \\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\nPREVALENCE OF MODERATE OR SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY \\n(PERCENTAGE)\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\nPREVALENCE OF MODERATE OR SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY \\n(PERCENTAGE)\\nHIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nSenegal Côte d'Ivoire\\nHIGH-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES LOW-FOOD-BUDGET COUNTRIES\\nNigeria Burkina Faso Malawi Niger\\nNigeria Guinea-Bissau Benin Togo Burkina Faso Malawi Niger\\nSevere food insecurity Moderate food insecurity\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\nUrban\\nPeri-urban\\nRural\\n38.9 40.0 38.7 40.5 40.3 40.6 42.9\\n39.3\\n52.4\\n63.5\\n69.7\\n54.0\\n40.3 41.1\\n22.5\\n68.8\\n79.3\\n45.4 48.2\\n43.3\\n35.3\\n61.7\\n65.866.366.967.3\\n45.9\\nLarge city (>1/uni00A0million people)\\n52.6\\nIntermediate city (0.25–1 million people)\\n44.7\\nSmall city (50–250 thousand people)\\n34.2\\nTown (20–50 thousand people)\\n25.1\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n43.6\\n<1 hour to an intermediate/uni00A0city\\n51.4\\n<1 hour to a town\\n61.4\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n37.8\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\n37.7\\n<1 hour to a small city\\nLarge city (>1/uni00A0million people)\\nIntermediate city (0.25–1 million people)\\nSmall city (50–250 thousand people)\\nTown (20–50 thousand people)\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n<1 hour to an intermediate/uni00A0city\\n<1 hour to a town\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\n<1 hour to a small city\\nLarge city (>1/uni00A0million people)\\nIntermediate city (0.25–1 million people)\\nSmall city (50–250 thousand people)\\nTown (20–50 thousand people)\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n<1 hour to an intermediate/uni00A0city\\n<1 hour to a town\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\n<1 hour to a small city\\nLarge city (>1/uni00A0million people)\\nIntermediate city (0.25–1 million people)\\nSmall city (50–250 thousand people)\\nTown (20–50 thousand people)\\n<1 hour to a large city\\n<1 hour to an intermediate/uni00A0city\\n<1 hour to a town\\n1–2 hours to a city or town\\n>2 hours to a city or town\\n<1 hour to a small city\\n41.8 44.4\\n37.4\\n33.9 34.9 36.2\\n41.3\\n45.5\\n41.9\\n35.534.6\\n37.8\\n42.2\\n48.2\\n51.5 50.4 50.8\\n62.5\\n42.5 43.345.8\\n55.9 57.4\\n52.7\\n60.7\\n83.9\\n79.2 81.2\\n87.6\\n78.2\\nNOTES: All surveys are for 2018/19, except Malawi (2019/20).

However, in the absence of SICTs, farmers \\nexcluded from the central market in a large city would \\nmost likely remain subsistence oriented. But when the \\npopulation is partially distributed in SICTs, farmers \\nwho were initially located too far from a large city to \\nproduce for its market can meet urban demand for food \\nfrom SICTs. 51 \\nA study focused on the large Indian city of \\nBangalore and its surroundings provides evidence that \\nmay confirm the essential role of SICTs in increasing \\nthe use of modern agricultural inputs in rural areas, \\nby offering improved linkages with markets. In some \\ncases, farmers located farther from Bangalore show \\na higher use of modern inputs due to the influence of \\nthe town of Doddaballapura. 52 In addition, evidence of \\nthe potential of SICTs for improving rural livelihoods \\nthrough non-agricultural jobs emerges in a later \\nstudy in Ethiopia, which shows that the expansion of \\nSICTs has a positive short-term effect on household \\nwelfare, driven by increased participation in the \\nnon-agriculture sector. 53\\nPolicy can strengthen intensification and increased \\nproductivity in farming close to SICTs, by improving \\nconnectivity between farms and input and output \\nmarkets, thus reducing the cost of access to both \\ndomestic and international markets and fostering \\nfarmers’ access to and use of modern inputs.\\n| 114 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 144, 'page_label': '115'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nSmall and medium enterprises can contribute \\nto nutrition improvements in rural areas by \\nenhancing smallholders’ access to markets \\nand inputs.

Supporting smallholder \\nfarmers in diversifying their production will \\nhave positive effects not only on the overall \\nsupply of nutritious foods, but also on the \\naccessibility of healthy diets in rural areas. \\nFor example, different kinds of input subsidies  \\n(direct distribution of inputs, vouchers or \\ntargeted preferential prices) have been shown \\nto have positive impacts in improving access \\nto diverse and more nutritious foods at the \\nhousehold level. 116 In Ethiopia, a study found \\nthat rural vegetable producers earned more \\nincome and were more food secure than \\nnon-vegetable producers. 118 Agricultural \\nextension is also important in rural areas, and \\ncan have positive effects on dietary diversity \\nand quality at household levels. 81 However, \\ncurrently extension programmes are often \\noriented towards staple crops rather than \\nnutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables. \\nap For instance, a study found changing expenditure patterns in \\nZambia from maize towards other cereals such as wheat, as well as to \\nvegetables and animal source foods, between 1996 and 2015, driven by \\nincome growth and urbanization. However, Zambian agricultural policy \\nis still focused mostly on maize, undermining the possibilities for \\nproduction diversification. 114 \\nChanging the focus of these programmes could \\nbe essential for increasing the availability of \\nthese foods. 115 \\nAs mentioned in the previous section, investing \\nin infrastructure is key for enhancing agrifood \\nsystems linkages across the rural–urban \\ncontinuum. From a productive perspective, \\ninvesting in irrigation is important for \\nboosting fruit and vegetable production, to \\nthe point that in India, producers that have \\naccess to irrigation infrastructure show \\nbetter dietary diversity outcomes. 119 In cases \\nin which the conditions and capabilities for \\nproducing diverse nutritious foods have yet \\nto be developed, biofortification  has shown to \\nbe a valid alternative method to improve the \\nnutrient intake and dietary quality of rural \\npopulations. aq The adoption of biofortified \\ncrops by smallholder farmers can improve \\nthe supply of essential micronutrients not \\nonly via own consumption, but also through \\ncommercialization in local markets and \\ninclusion in social protection programmes \\nincluding in-kind food transfers and school \\nmeal programmes (the latter in all kinds of \\nsettings across the rural–urban continuum). 120\\nIt is important to highlight that many studies \\nin rural settings have found that women’s \\nempowerment is one of the most important \\npathways through which food production \\npolicies can have positive effects on access to \\nnutritious foods and, in turn, on food security \\nand nutrition outcomes, particularly in rural \\nareas.

Farmers are involved in \\nparticipatory plant breeding of rice varieties, \\nfarmer-to-farmer exchanges, and participatory \\nguarantee systems for increased market access \\nof organic products. 209  Organic farming is also \\na common practice in UPA, with manure and \\nurban waste compost frequently utilized to \\nimprove soil fertility. For example, the Kibera \\nYouth Reform Organic Farm, which began on a \\ngarbage dump in Africa’s largest slum in Nairobi, \\ngrows a range of crops for own consumption \\nas well as for sale. 210 Since organic agriculture \\ndoes not rely on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, \\nnitrogen availability is the primary impediment \\nto the global expansion of organic agriculture. 211 \\nAdditional issues relate to the potential exclusion \\nof small-scale producers due to the cost of \\ncertification and to the price of organic products, \\nwhich are often too high for consumers. 212 \\nControlled environment agriculture (CEA),  also \\nreferred to as vertical or indoor soil-less farming , \\nencompasses numerous technologies including \\nhydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics. \\nVertical farming requires only a small plot of \\nland and can be carried out indoors, allowing for \\nthe cultivation of food in urban and industrial \\nspaces, and leading to shorter supply chains. \\nFor short-cycle fast-growing horticultural crops \\nsuch as lettuce and leafy herbs, production in a \\ncontrolled environment can cut water use by up \\nto 95\\xa0percent while supplying consistent-quality, \\nhigh-value products all year round. Vertical \\nfarms can minimize risks of foodborne illnesses \\nand considerably reduce the need for both \\ninputs (e.g. fertilizers and pesticides) and water \\n(through recycling). For cereals such as wheat, \\nstudies have shown that yields in indoor vertical \\nfarms could be 220\\xa0to 600\\xa0times higher than \\nyields in the field, while at the same time using \\nless land. 213 However, the high energy cost of \\nproducing artificial lighting and maintaining \\ntemperature and air quality makes the adoption \\nof CEA viable mostly in HICs.

The same \\nprinciples can be extended to food procurement \\nand service policies for other locally run \\ninstitutions or services. 247\\nFood waste and circular economy initiatives \\nare another common entry point for initiating \\nfood planning and policy processes. Food \\nwaste can be converted to compost or used \\nto produce biogas, thereby avoiding harmful \\nmethane emissions while also creating \\nemployment opportunities; fish offal and waste \\ncan also be used to produce fish silage which \\nserves as fishmeal in animal feed. However, \\nthis requires municipal organic waste to be \\nproperly managed not only at the household \\nlevel, but also in food retailing outlets. Local \\ninstitutions play a critical role in creating an \\nenabling environment to reduce food waste \\nand adopt waste management practices. For \\nexample, in Bangladesh, municipal food \\nwaste in Khulna city is being used to meet the \\nhigh demand for organic compost fertilizer \\nin the agroforestry sector; but the process \\nhas required support from local institutions \\nto produce compost at a suitable level. In \\nrelation to food waste management, priority \\nis also given to prevention, recovery and \\nredistribution for human consumption – a \\nprocess requiring a high level of engagement \\nof local governments. 248  Furthermore, in \\nKigali, Rwanda, a thematic multistakeholder \\ntaskforce on food waste management has \\nbeen created as part of the broader agrifood \\nsystems stakeholder advisory group addressing \\nissues related to prevention, recovery, \\nredistribution and the circular economy. The \\nKigali Municipality has assumed leadership \\nof the platform to strengthen the spatial and \\nfunctional agrifood systems linkages across the \\nrural–urban continuum in Rwanda. \\nThe degree of decentralization in different \\ncontexts and the level of technical capacity can \\nlimit the effectiveness of such local policies \\nand strategies. For example, despite major \\ndecentralization efforts in recent decades, \\nlocal African governments still have low \\nadministrative and fiscal capacity; consequently, \\nin some cases strategic plans are not implemented \\ndue to lack of funding. Linking food policies and \\nstrategies to the fiscal decision-making process is \\ntherefore indispensable. 249 \\nDue to the multisectoral and multilevel nature of \\nagrifood systems, funding to implement the key \\nactivities of a food strategy and/or action plan \\ncan come from a variety of sources: municipal, \\nprovincial, national, and even non-state actors \\nsuch as non-governmental organizations and \\ninternational partners. Mobilization of internal \\nand external resources for effective public \\nand private financing is crucial, both in terms \\nof supporting the actions of authorities at all \\nlevels and creating incentives to attract private \\ncapital towards financially viable investment \\nopportunities. 236,\\xa0238,\\xa0240  \\nPolicy coherence at national and subnational \\nlevels remains a key challenge in establishing \\nthe appropriate enabling environment. \\nNational and regional governments usually \\nhave the mandate and resources to invest in \\ninfrastructure development for well-connected \\nrural and urban areas, and have access to \\npolicy instruments dealing with the role \\nof the private sector in agrifood systems \\ntransformation. 250  As mentioned earlier in \\nthis Chapter\\xa05, investments in general services \\nsupport in SICTs could scale up private \\ninvestments and take advantage of the closer \\nspatial and functional links that urbanization \\nis creating across the rural–urban continuum. \\nTherefore, these policies and investments will \\nrequire strong multilevel governance across \\nnational and regional agrifood systems policies \\nin order to promote the necessary structural \\ntransformation of agrifood systems. In order \\nto address a specific issue systemically and \\nencourage agrifood systems transformation, \\ncoordinated actions across horizontal and \\nvertical dimensions of governance are needed. \\nHorizontal governance refers to the coordination \\nand/or integration among sectoral institutions \\n(e.g.\\xa0related to trade, agriculture, health and \\nplanning) and/or with non-governmental \\nactors such as research institutions, civil \\nsociety organizations, representatives of the \\nprivate sector, and financial institutions. \\n| 138 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 168, 'page_label': '139'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nFor example, as agrifood systems usually \\nfall under the mandate of multiple agencies, \\nto improve national coordination among \\nthem, countries are creating interministerial \\ncommittees or similar mechanisms to manage \\ndecentralization processes and implement \\nagroterritorial initiatives.

Progress on important indicators of child \\nnutrition is to be celebrated, and some regions \\nare on track to achieve some of the nutrition \\ntargets by 2030. However, rising overweight \\namong children under five years of age in \\nmany countries portends growing burdens of \\nnon-communicable diseases.\\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \\nis a vision of a healthier, more just and equal \\nworld – a world without poverty, hunger and \\nmalnutrition. While these goals may seem out \\nof reach, the lack of an increase in hunger may \\nsignal the beginning of a turnaround, and any \\nimprovement in the nutrition of children bodes \\nwell for the future. Achieving food security \\nand nutrition goals is not only good for those \\nsuffering from food insecurity and malnutrition, \\nit is good for everyone. A healthier, more just and \\nequal world is better for all. \\nSince its 2017 edition, this report has offered an \\nin-depth thematic analysis of the underlying \\ncauses and drivers of observed food insecurity \\nand malnutrition trends and how food security \\nand nutrition SDG 2 targets are related to \\nother SDG targets. The report has repeatedly \\nhighlighted that the intensification and \\ninteraction of conflict, climate extremes and \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns, combined \\nwith highly unaffordable nutritious foods \\nand growing inequality, are pushing us off \\ntrack to meet the SDG\\xa02 targets. While policy \\nrecommendations have been offered to build \\nresilience against these adversities, this year \\nthe report underscores the importance of also \\nconsidering other important megatrends. \\nUrbanization has featured as the theme of \\nthis year’s report. With almost seven in ten \\npeople projected to live in cities by 2050, this \\nmegatrend is shaping agrifood systems and, as a \\nconsequence, their capacity to deliver affordable \\nhealthy diets for all and to help eradicate hunger, \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition. Urbanization \\nalso has relevance for SDG\\xa011 (Sustainable \\nCities and Communities), SDG\\xa01 (No Poverty), \\nSDG\\xa02 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG\\xa010 \\n(Reduced Inequalities) and SDG\\xa012 (Responsible \\nConsumption and Production). Therefore, the \\nfindings and policy recommendations from \\nanalysing urbanization in this report can inform \\nefforts of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \\nDevelopment, as well as other ongoing efforts, \\nincluding those in the framework of the United \\nNations General Assembly-endorsed New Urban \\nAgenda and the coalitions of action established \\nafter the United Nations Food Systems Summit.\\nA key conclusion is that the ways in which \\nurbanization is shaping agrifood systems can only \\nbe understood with a rural–urban continuum \\nlens; the simple concept of a rural–urban divide \\nis no longer useful to understand the growing \\nlinks across urban, peri-urban and rural areas. \\nThis growing connectivity across the rural–urban \\n| 143 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 173, 'page_label': '144'}, page_content='CHAPTER 6  CONCLUSION\\nfundamental actors in leveraging multilevel and \\nmultistakeholder mechanisms that, as shown with \\nconcrete examples in this report, have proved \\neffective in implementing essential policies and \\nsolutions for making healthy diets available and \\naffordable for all.\\nNew empirical evidence presented in this report for \\n11 Western, Eastern and Southern African countries \\nalso challenges traditional thinking and reveals \\nimportant food consumption patterns, including \\ncontinuum is a key aspect today to understand \\nthe functioning of value chains.

For example, it calls into question the \\ntraditional notion that Africa’s rural farmers largely \\nproduce their own food. The affordability of a \\nhealthy diet is actually found to be a critical issue \\nfor rural households in these countries because \\nthey are more – not to say the most – reliant on food \\npurchases. The\\xa0new evidence also runs counter \\nto conventional thinking that purchase patterns \\nbetween urban and rural areas differ markedly, at \\nleast for some food groups. \\nIn these countries, the diffusion of processed \\nfoods, including highly processed foods, \\nassociated with urban areas is now seen in \\nrural areas as well. Unfortunately, low-income \\nhouseholds living in peri-urban and rural areas in \\nthese countries would need to more than double \\nwhat they spend on food to secure a healthy \\ndiet. Moreover, food insecurity is no longer a \\npredominantly rural problem, as levels of both \\nsevere and moderate or severe food insecurity \\nacross urban areas (large, intermediate and small \\ncities and towns) and peri-urban areas (less than \\n1\\xa0hour travel to large, intermediate and small \\ncities) were found to be similar to or even higher \\nthan those in rural areas in some of the countries \\nanalysed. The prevalence of stunting, wasting \\nand overweight in children under five years of \\nage can also show important variations across the \\nrural–urban continuum. \\nUnfortunately, we have learned through this \\nreport that such valuable granular analysis \\nof food consumption patterns, affordability \\nof healthy diets, and food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition across the rural–urban continuum \\ncannot currently be replicated for more \\ncountries and regions of the world, and that \\nrenewed efforts in food security and nutrition \\ndata collection and analysis are needed. The \\nanalysis has relied on the newly available URCA \\nglobal dataset, which provides a georeferenced \\nmapping of the spatial and functional \\nconnectivity across urban, peri-urban and rural \\nareas, using latitudinal and longitudinal data \\nof households from the most recent household \\nsurveys. This combination has made it possible \\nto work with different categories of catchment \\nareas defined across the rural–urban continuum \\nfor the said 11\\xa0African countries. Unfortunately, \\ngeoreferenced nationally representative \\nhousehold survey data are currently only \\navailable for a handful of datasets which have \\nlatitude and longitude information that is \\npublicly available, and all of them are for Africa. \\nIt is then in the best interest of governments \\nof other countries and regions that such data \\nbecome available for public use, or, if the \\ndata are lacking, that governments invest in \\ndata development to bridge this important \\ngap. Only then will decision-makers of those \\ncountries and regions be able to rely on an \\nanalysis, similar to that presented in this report, \\nto inform their policies and investments in \\nways that leverage urbanization to accelerate \\nagrifood systems transformation in the quest to \\nsecure affordable healthy diets, food security \\nand adequate nutrition for all across the \\nrural–urban continuum. n\\n| 145 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author':

National estimates are \\nreported as three-year moving averages, to control \\nfor the low reliability of the estimates of some \\nof the underlying parameters due to elements \\nfor which complete, reliable information is very \\nscarce, such as the year-to-year variation in food \\ncommodity stocks, one of the components of the \\nannual FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS). Regional \\nand global aggregates, on the other hand, \\nare reported as annual estimates, as possible \\nestimation errors are expected not to be correlated \\nand therefore to be greatly reduced to acceptable \\nlevels when aggregating across countries.\\nThe entire series of PoU values is revised with each \\nnew edition of this report to reflect new data and \\ninformation that FAO has obtained since the release \\nof the previous edition. As this process usually \\nimplies backward revisions of the entire PoU series, \\nreaders are advised to refrain from comparing \\nseries across different editions of this report and \\nshould always refer to the current edition of the \\nreport, including for values in past years.\\nMethodology: To compute an estimate of the \\nprevalence of undernourishment in a population, \\nthe probability distribution of habitual dietary \\nenergy intake levels (expressed in kcal per person \\nper day) for the average individual is modelled \\nas a parametric probability density function, \\nf(x).1,\\xa02  The indicator is obtained as the cumulative \\nprobability that the habitual dietary energy \\nintake ( x) is below the minimum dietary energy \\nrequirement (MDER) (i.e. the lowest limit of the \\nrange of energy requirements that is appropriate \\nfor the population’s representative average \\nindividual) as in the formula below:\\nPoU = ∫x<MDER  f(x|θ)dx,\\nwhere θ is a vector of parameters that \\ncharacterizes the probability density function. \\nIn the actual computations, the distribution \\nis assumed to be lognormal and thus fully \\ncharacterized by only two parameters: the mean \\ndietary energy consumption (DEC) and its \\ncoefficient of variation (CV). \\nData source: Different data sources are used to \\nestimate the different parameters of the model.\\nMinimum dietary energy requirement (MDER):  Human \\nenergy requirements for an individual in a given \\nsex/age class are determined on the basis of \\nnormative requirements for basic metabolic rate \\nper kilogram of body mass, multiplied by the \\nideal weights that a healthy person of that sex/age \\nclass may have, given his or her height, and then \\nmultiplied by a coefficient of physical activity \\nlevel (PAL) to take into account physical activity. bd \\nGiven that both healthy body mass indices (BMIs) \\nand normal PALs vary among active and healthy \\nindividuals of the same sex and age, a range of \\nenergy requirements applies to each sex and \\nage group of the population.

Since the last edition \\nof this report, 14 new surveys from the following \\n10 countries have been processed to update the \\nCV|y: Argentina (2018), Armenia (2019, 2020, \\n2021), Benin (2019), Bhutan (2012), Cambodia \\n(2019), Guinea-Bissau (2019), Mexico (2012, 2020), \\nMongolia (2020, 2021), Peru (2019) and Uruguay \\n(2017). That makes for a total of 129 surveys from \\n65 countries for which the estimate of the CV|y is \\nbased on data from national surveys. \\nWhen no suitable survey data are available, \\nFood Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) data \\ncollected by FAO since 2014 are used to project \\nthe changes in the CV|y from 2015 (or from the \\nyear of the last food consumption survey, if \\nmore recent) up to 2019, based on the observed \\ntrend in severe food insecurity. The projections \\nare based on the assumption that observed \\nchanges in the extent of severe food insecurity \\nmeasured with the FIES might be indicative of \\nequivalent changes in the PoU. To the extent \\nthat such implied changes in the PoU cannot be \\nfully explained by the “supply-side” effects of \\nchanges in average food supplies, they can be \\nconfidently attributed to unobserved changes \\nin the CV|y that might have occurred at the \\nsame time. Analysis of historical PoU estimates \\nreveals that, on average, and once differences \\nin DEC, MDER and CV|r have been controlled \\nfor, differences in the CV|y explain about \\none-third of the differences in PoU across time \\nand space. Based on all this, for each country \\nfor which FIES data are available, the change \\nin the CV|y that may have occurred from 2015, \\nor from the date of the last available survey, is \\ntherefore estimated as the change that would \\ngenerate one-third of a percentage point change \\nin the PoU for each observed percentage \\npoint change in the prevalence of severe food \\ninsecurity. For all other countries, lacking any \\nsupporting evidence, the CV|y is kept constant \\nat the last available estimate. As in last year’s \\nreport, the nowcast of the CV|y for 2020, 2021 \\nand 2022 required special treatment to account \\nfor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \\n(see\\xa0 Annex\\xa02, Section\\xa0A).\\nCV|r\\nCV|r represents the variability of the distribution \\nof dietary energy requirements of a hypothetical \\naverage individual representative of a healthy \\npopulation, which is also equal to the CV of \\nthe distribution of dietary energy intakes of \\na hypothetical average individual if everyone \\nin the population were perfectly nourished. \\nFor\\xa0estimation purposes, the distribution \\nof dietary energy requirements of such a \\nhypothetical average individual is assumed to \\nbe normal and its standard deviation can be \\nestimated from any two known percentiles. We \\nuse the MDER and the ADER mentioned above \\nto approximate the 1st and the 50th percentiles. 8, \\n9 The value of CV|r is then derived as the inverse \\ncumulative standard normal distribution of the \\ndifference between the MDER and the ADER.\\nChallenges and limitations: While formally the state \\nof being undernourished or not is a condition \\nthat applies to individuals, given the data usually \\navailable on a large scale, it is impossible to \\nreliably identify which individuals in a certain \\ngroup are actually undernourished. Through the \\nstatistical model described above, the indicator \\ncan only be computed with reference to a \\npopulation or a group of individuals for which \\na sufficiently representative sample is available. \\nThe prevalence of undernourishment is thus an \\nestimate of the percentage of individuals in that \\ngroup that are in such condition, but it cannot be \\nfurther disaggregated.\\nDue to the probabilistic nature of the inference \\nand the margins of uncertainty associated with \\nestimates of each of the parameters in the model, \\nthe precision of the PoU estimates is generally \\nlow. While it is not possible to formally compute \\nmargins of error around PoU estimates, they \\nare expected to exceed 5\\xa0percent in most cases. \\nFor\\xa0this reason, FAO does not consider PoU \\nestimates that result lower than 2.5\\xa0percent as \\nsufficiently reliable to be reported. \\nIt is important to note that the ranges presented \\nfor the values of the PoU in 2020, 2021 and 2022 \\nshould not be interpreted as statistical confidence \\nintervals.

The severity of food \\ninsecurity is measured using data collected with \\nthe Food Insecurity Experience Scale Survey \\nModule (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions \\nasking respondents to self-report conditions \\nand experiences typically associated with \\nlimited access to food. For purposes of annual \\nSDG monitoring, the questions are asked with \\nreference to the 12\\xa0months preceding the survey.\\nUsing sophisticated statistical techniques based \\non the Rasch measurement model, the information \\nobtained in an FIES-SM survey is validated \\nfor internal consistency and converted into a \\nquantitative measure along a scale of severity, \\nranging from low to high. Based on their responses \\nto the survey items, the individuals or households \\ninterviewed in a nationally representative survey \\nof the population are assigned a probability of \\nbeing in one of three classes: i)\\xa0food secure or only \\nmarginally insecure; ii)\\xa0moderately food insecure; \\nand iii)\\xa0severely food insecure, as defined by \\ntwo globally set thresholds. Based on FIES data \\ncollected over three years from 2014 to 2016, FAO \\nhas established the FIES reference scale, which is \\nused as the global standard for experience-based \\nfood-insecurity measures, and to set the two \\nreference thresholds of severity.\\nSDG Indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated \\nprobability to be in the two classes of moderate \\nand severe food insecurity. A separate indicator \\n(FIsev) is computed by considering only the severe \\nfood insecurity class.\\nHow it is reported:  In this report, FAO provides \\nestimates of food insecurity at two different \\nlevels of severity: moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity (FI mod+sev ), and severe food insecurity \\n(FIsev). For each of these two levels, two \\nestimates are reported:\\n \\x84 the prevalence (percent) of individuals in the \\npopulation living in households where at least \\none adult was found to be food insecure; and\\n \\x84 the estimated number of individuals  in the \\npopulation living in households where at least \\none adult was found to be food insecure.\\nData source:  Since 2014, the eight-question FIES-SM \\nhas been applied in nationally representative \\nsamples of the adult population (defined as aged \\n15\\xa0or older) in more than 140\\xa0countries included \\nin the Gallup © World Poll (GWP), covering more \\nthan 90\\xa0percent of the world population. In 2022, \\ninterviews were conducted in both telephone and \\nface-to-face modality. Telephone interviews were \\nmaintained in some countries already covered \\nwith this modality in 2020 given the high risk \\nof community transmission from conducting \\nface-to-face data collection during the COVID-19 \\npandemic. By evaluating dual frame coverage \\n(i.e. the proportion of the adult population that is \\ncovered by a combination of landline and mobile \\nphones), countries with a minimum of 70\\xa0percent \\ncoverage were included as part of the 2020 GWP \\nthrough computer-assisted telephone interviews. \\nGallup © traditionally uses telephone surveys in \\nNorthern America, Western Europe, some parts of \\nAsia, and Cooperation Council for the Arab States \\nof the Gulf countries.

In such situations, the protocol is \\nto look for external information for the country \\n(data and/or reports, possibly in consultation \\nwith country experts like FAO country or \\nregional officers) to explore whether big shocks \\nor interventions have occurred. If the trend \\ncan be justified by supporting evidence, but \\nseems excessive, the trend is kept but smoothed \\n(for example, using the three-year average). \\nOtherwise, the same protocol used for missing \\nyears is applied (i.e.\\xa0keeping the level constant \\nor applying the subregional trend).

To arrive at \\nthe prevalence and number of individuals (of all \\nages) in the population, an estimate is required of \\nthe number of people living in households where \\nat least one adult is estimated to be food insecure. \\nThis involves a multistep procedure detailed \\nin Annex\\xa0II of the Voices of the Hungry Technical \\nReport  (see link in the “Recommended readings” \\nsection, below). \\nRegional and global aggregates of food insecurity \\nat moderate or severe, and severe levels, FI L,r, \\nare computed as:\\nFIL,r = ∑c FI L,c  × Nc\\n∑c Nc\\nwhere r indicates the region, FI L,c  is the value \\nof FI at level L  estimated for country c in the \\nregion, and N c is the corresponding population \\nsize. When no estimate of FI L is available for \\na country, it is assumed to be equal to the \\npopulation-weighted average of the estimated \\nvalues of the remaining countries in the same \\nsubregion. A regional aggregate is produced only \\nif the countries for which an estimate is available \\ncover at least 50\\xa0percent of the region’s population.\\nUniversal thresholds are defined on the FIES \\nglobal standard scale (a set of item parameter \\nvalues based on results from all countries covered \\nby the GWP in 2014–2016) and converted into \\ncorresponding values on local scales. The process \\nof calibrating each country’s scale against the FIES \\nglobal standard can be referred to as equating  \\nand permits the production of internationally \\ncomparable measures of food insecurity severity \\nfor individual respondents, as well as comparable \\nnational prevalence rates.\\nThe problem stems from the fact that, when \\ndefined as a latent trait, the severity of food \\ninsecurity has no absolute reference against \\nwhich it could be evaluated. The Rasch model \\nenables identification of the relative position \\nthat the various items occupy on a scale that is \\ndenominated in logit units but whose “zero” \\nis arbitrarily set, usually to correspond to the \\nmean estimated severity. This implies that the \\nzero of the scale changes in each application. \\nTo produce comparable measures over time and \\nacross different populations requires establishing \\na common scale to use as a reference and finding \\nthe formula needed to convert measures across \\ndifferent scales. As is the case for converting \\nmeasures of temperature across difference \\nmeasuring scales (such as Celsius and Fahrenheit), \\nthis requires the identification of a number of \\n“anchoring” points. In the FIES methodology, \\nthese anchoring points are the severity levels \\nassociated with the items whose relative position \\non the scale of severity can be considered equal \\nto that of the corresponding items on the global \\nreference scale. The “mapping” of the measures \\nfrom one scale to the other is then obtained by \\nfinding the formula that equates the mean and \\nthe standard deviation (SD) of the common items’ \\nseverity levels.\\nChallenges and limitations:  When food-insecurity \\nprevalence estimates are based on FIES data \\ncollected in the GWP , with national sample sizes of \\nabout 1\\xa0000\\xa0individuals in most countries, confidence \\nintervals rarely exceed 20\\xa0percent of the measured \\nprevalence (that is, prevalence rates of 50\\xa0percent \\nwould have margins of error of up to plus or minus \\n5\\xa0percent). Confidence intervals are likely to be much \\nsmaller, however, when national prevalence rates \\nare estimated using larger samples and for estimates \\nreferring to aggregates of several countries.  \\nTo reduce the impact of year-to-year sampling \\nvariability, country-level estimates are presented \\nas three-year averages, computed as averages of all \\navailable years in the considered triennia.\\nRecom mended readings:\\nFAO. 2016.

For wasting, \\nthe JME country dataset serves as the country \\nestimates themselves (i.e. the wasting prevalence \\nin the JME country dataset from a household \\nsurvey for a country in a given year is the \\nwasting prevalence reported for that country \\nin that year). For stunting and overweight, \\nthe JME country dataset is used to generate \\ncountry -modelled estimates which serve as the \\nofficial JME estimates (i.e. the stunting prevalence \\nfrom a household survey for a given country in \\na given year is not reported as the prevalence \\nfor that country in that year; rather, it feeds into \\nthe modelled estimates described in the next \\nsection below).  \\nCountry-level model for stunting and  \\noverweight estimates\\nThe technical details of the statistical models are \\nprovided elsewhere. 10 Briefly, for both stunting and \\noverweight, the prevalence was modelled at logit \\n(log-odds) scale using a penalized longitudinal \\nmixed model with a heterogeneous error term. \\nThe quality of the models was quantified with \\nmodel-fit criteria that balance the complexity of the \\nmodel with the closeness of the fit to the observed \\ndata. The proposed method has important \\ncharacteristics, including non-linear time \\ntrends, regional trends, country-specific trends, \\ncovariate data and a heterogeneous error term. \\nAll countries with data contribute to estimates of \\nthe overall time trend and the impact of covariate \\ndata on the prevalence. For overweight, the \\ncovariate data consisted of linear and quadratic \\nsociodemographic index (SDI), be and data source \\ntype.

The results for the 205\\xa0countries can \\nbe used to calculate estimates and uncertainty \\nintervals for any group of countries aggregated. \\nThe uncertainty intervals are important in \\nmonitoring trends, especially for countries with \\nsparse data and where primary data sources \\npresent large primary data source sampling errors. \\nWhen only sparse data are available in the most \\nrecent period, the inclusion of a survey can affect \\na substantial change in the predicted trajectory. \\nFor this reason, uncertainty intervals are needed \\nto enhance trend interpretability in terms of the \\ncaution level employed.

This is because the JME are based \\non national-level country prevalence data, \\nwhich come from cross-sectional surveys (i.e.\\xa0a \\nsnapshot at one point in time) that are collected \\ninfrequently (every three to five years) in most \\ncountries. Since stunting and overweight are \\nrelatively stable over the course of a calendar \\nyear, it is reasonable to track changes in these two \\nconditions over time with these data, whereas \\nwasting is an acute condition that can change \\nfrequently and rapidly. An individual child can be \\naffected by wasting more than once in a calendar \\nyear (i.e.\\xa0can recover but then become wasted \\nagain in the same year), and the risk of wasting \\nin many contexts can be driven by seasonal \\nvariations, which can result in seasonal spikes \\nin prevalence. For example, wasting prevalence, \\nin some contexts, may double between the \\npost-harvest season (often associated with higher \\nfood availability and weather patterns that are \\nless likely to cause disease) and the pre-harvest \\nseason (often associated with food shortages, \\nheavy rains and related diseases that can affect \\nnutrition status).

While every effort has \\nbeen made to maximize the comparability of \\nstatistics across countries and over time, country \\ndata may differ in terms of data collection \\nmethods, population coverage and estimation \\nmethods used. Survey estimates come with levels \\nof uncertainty due to both sampling errors and \\nnon-sampling errors (technical measurement \\nerrors, recording errors,\\xa0etc.). Neither of the two \\nsources of error has been fully taken into account \\nfor deriving estimates at the country or regional \\nand global levels. \\nFor the prevalence of wasting, as surveys are \\ngenerally carried out during a specific period \\nof the year, the estimates can be affected by \\nseasonality. Seasonal factors related to wasting \\ninclude food availability (e.g.\\xa0pre-harvest \\nperiods) and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea, \\nmalaria,\\xa0etc.), while natural disasters and conflicts \\ncan also show real shifts in trends that would \\nneed to be treated differently from a seasonal \\nvariation. Hence, country-year estimates for \\nwasting may not necessarily be comparable over \\ntime.

National administrative data are those \\ncoming from national systems including civil \\nregistration and vital statistics systems, national \\nhealth management information systems and \\nbirth registries.  National household surveys \\nwhich contain information about birthweight as \\nwell as key related indicators including maternal \\nperception of size at birth (MICS, DHS) are also \\nan important source of data on low birthweight \\nespecially in contexts where many births are \\nunweighed and/or data heaping is a problem. \\nPrior to entry into the country dataset, country \\ndata are reviewed for coverage and quality \\nand adjusted where the source is a household \\nsurvey. To be included, available birthweights \\nfrom administrative data need to cover at least \\n80\\xa0percent of the UN DESA World Population \\nProspects  estimated live births for that year. To be \\nincluded in the dataset, survey data need to have: \\ni. a birthweight in the dataset for a minimum of \\n30\\xa0percent of the sample; \\nii. a minimum of 200\\xa0birthweights in the dataset;\\niii. no indication of severe data heaping – this \\nmeans that: a) ≤55\\xa0percent of all birthweights \\ncan fall on the three most frequent \\nbirthweights (i.e. if 3\\xa0000\\xa0g, 3\\xa0500\\xa0g and 2\\xa0500\\xa0g \\nwere the three most frequent birthweights, \\nwhen added together, they would have to \\nmake up ≤55\\xa0percent of all birthweights in the \\ndataset); b)\\xa0≤10\\xa0percent of all birthweights are \\n≥4 500\\xa0g; and c)\\xa0≤5\\xa0percent of birthweights fall \\non tail ends of 500\\xa0g and 5\\xa0000\\xa0g; and\\niv. undergone an adjustment for missing \\nbirthweights and heaping. 12\\nEstimates of low birthweight prevalence at the \\nnational level were predicted from a Bayesian \\nmultilevel-regression model. 13 The model is \\nfit on the logit (log-odds) scale to ensure that \\nproportions are bounded between zero and one, \\nand then back-transformed and multiplied by 100 \\nto obtain prevalence estimates. \\nHierarchical random country-specific intercepts \\n(countries within regions within global) accounted \\nfor the correlation within and between the regions. \\nThe six SDG regions were adapted and used in \\nthe modelling. Penalized splines were used as \\ntemporal smoothing across the time series 26–28, \\nmeaning that country-level non-linear time trends \\nwere captured without random variation affecting \\nthe trend. Country-level covariates were also \\nincluded in the modelling. The final covariates \\nincluded in the model were: gross national income \\nper person purchasing power parity (constant \\n2017 international dollars), the prevalence of \\nunderweight among female adults, the adult female \\nliteracy rate, the modern contraception prevalence \\nrate and the percentage of urban population. \\nAlongside this, data quality categories ( Table\\xa0A1.5) \\nwere used to apply bias shifts and additional \\nvariance terms.

Regional and global \\naggregates were then produced using estimates from \\nall 195\\xa0countries and areas.\\nChallenges and limitations:  A major limitation of \\nmonitoring low birthweight globally is the lack of \\nbirthweight data for many of the world’s children. \\nHere there is a notable bias, with children born \\nto poorer, less educated, rural mothers being \\nless likely to have a recorded birthweight when \\ncompared to their richer, urban counterparts \\nwith more highly educated mothers. 13 As the \\ncharacteristics of the unweighed are risk factors \\nbf While the world comprises 203 countries in the FAO regional \\ngrouping, eight countries did not have low birthweight input data or \\ncovariate data. It was therefore not possible to generate any estimates \\nfor these countries, and they are not included in the regional and \\nglobal estimates.\\nfor having a low birthweight, estimates that do \\nnot well represent these children may be lower \\nthan the true value. Furthermore, poor quality of \\navailable data with regard to excessive heaping on \\nmultiples of 500\\xa0g or 100\\xa0g exists in the majority of \\navailable data from LMICs 13 and can further bias \\nlow birthweight estimates. The methods applied \\nto adjust for missing birthweights and heaping \\nfor survey estimates in the current database 13 are \\nmeant to address the problem. A recent validation \\nstudy found that the adjusted low birthweight \\nestimate was similar to the true prevalence while \\nthe unadjusted value didn’t capture even half of \\nthe low-weight births in one population. 14 \\nThe administrative input data also have \\nlimitations, including a lack of individual-level \\ndata, and limited information on heaping \\nand missing birthweights. The data quality \\ncategorization ( Table\\xa0A1.5) attempted to account \\nfor this by grouping countries according to data \\nquality indicators, but more robust methods need \\nto be developed to adjust for administrative data \\nquality differences at an individual country level \\nas opposed to having a single bias adjustment \\nfor a group of countries.

Adjustments of data on blood \\nhaemoglobin concentrations for altitude and \\nsmoking were carried out whenever possible. \\nBiologically implausible haemoglobin values \\n(<25\\xa0g/L or >200\\xa0g/L) were excluded. A Bayesian \\nhierarchical mixture model was used to estimate \\nhaemoglobin distributions and systematically \\naddress missing data, non-linear time trends, and \\nrepresentativeness of data sources.

Methodology for estimating the PoU for \\n2020, 2021 and 2022\\nAs in previous editions of this report, due to lack \\nof direct information on the most recent values of \\neach of the elements that contribute to computing \\nthe prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) and \\nnumber of undernourished people (NoU) (see \\nAnnex\\xa01B), estimates referring to the most recent \\nyears are nowcasted; in other words, they are \\npredictions of the very recent past.\\nAs already noted in last year’s edition of this \\nreport, 2020 and 2021 were unique in many \\nrespects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and \\nits lingering effects. This demanded special \\nconsiderations when nowcasting the values of \\nthe PoU, especially with respect to estimating \\nthe likely change in the coefficient of variation \\n(CV) and to modelling the way in which \\ninequality in access to food contributes to rates of \\nundernourishment. Both aspects required special \\ntreatment in consideration of the very special \\nconditions under which food systems operated \\nduring the pandemic. \\nThe strategy used to project values of the CV|y \\nfrom 2019 to 2021 and the ranges of global PoU \\nand NoU estimates followed the same approach \\nas in last year’s edition of this report, while \\nadditional considerations were made for 2022. \\nBoth are described below.\\nProjecting CV|y up to 2021\\nWhile the values of dietary energy consumption \\n(DEC) are nowcasted using the traditional \\napproach based on information provided by \\nthe Markets and Trade Division of FAO, used to \\ninform FAO Agricultural Outlooks, the traditional \\napproach used to nowcast the CV had to be \\nmodified to reflect the peculiar conditions of \\n2020 and 2021. Normally, changes in CV|y (the \\ncomponent of the CV associated with differences \\nin households’ economic conditions) are derived \\nfrom differences in three-year averages of the \\nprevalence of severe food insecurity based on \\nthe FIES (FI sev) that are not explained by changes \\nin food supplies. Use of the three-year average \\naddressed the need to control for possible excess \\nsampling variability in country-level estimates \\nof the FI sev (which, for most countries, is based \\non relatively small samples of FIES data) and is \\nconsistent with an assumption that CV|y follows \\na relatively stable trend. The exceptional nature \\nof 2020 and 2021 made it difficult to maintain \\nthat last assumption. Because of that, the changes \\nbetween the 2017–2019 average and the 2020 \\nannual values of FI sev  were used to nowcast the \\n2020 values of CV|y, and the changes between the \\n2020 and 2021 annual values of FI sev  were used to \\nnowcast the 2021 values of CV|y.\\nAnother parameter that needed attention to \\nnowcast the 2020 value of PoU was the percentage \\nof change in FI sev  (used as a proxy for the \\nexpected change in the PoU) that is attributed \\nto CV|y. Normally, this had been assumed to \\nbe equal to one-third, based on an econometric \\nanalysis of past values of PoU, DEC and CV|y. \\nThe exceptional nature of 2020 and 2021 called \\ninto question that regularity. As no national \\nhousehold consumption and expenditure survey \\ndata in 2020 or in 2021 were available, there is \\nstill no empirical basis to determine how to \\nproperly modify it. The solution was to conduct \\na sensitivity analysis modifying the percentage \\nof change in FI sev  that is attributed to CV|y from \\na minimum of one-third to a maximum of one. \\nThis defined the lower and upper bounds of the \\nestimated series for 2020 and 2021.\\nSpecial considerations for 2022\\nWhile the main effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \\nhave receded and data collection began to \\nnormalize in 2022, there is still considerable \\nuncertainty regarding the extent of the changes \\nin inequality in access to food that may have \\noccurred that year. It is not yet known whether \\nthe pandemic and all other disruptive events that \\nhave affected agrifood systems worldwide in the \\nlast three years have had any persisting effect \\non the relative roles of demand and supply side \\nelements in people’s access to food. This, in turn, \\ndemanded a slight modification of the approach \\nto produce nowcasts of the CV|y, and hence of \\nthe PoU, in 2022.\\nIn particular, the value of 33\\xa0percent as probable \\ncontribution of changes in the CV to the observed \\n| 194 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 224, 'page_label': '195'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\nchanges in the PoU was used to produce the \\nmid-point of the estimated series, reflecting \\nwhat would be a “back-to-normal” situation \\n(see Annex\\xa01B). Then, additional values of \\n50, 67 and 100\\xa0percent were used, separately \\nfor each country, reflecting possible different \\nassumptions about the way in which CV|y might \\nhave contributed to PoU in 2022. Note however \\nthat, contrary to what was the case in 2020 and \\n2021, when FIES-based estimates revealed food \\ninsecurity worsening practically everywhere, the \\nimplications of assuming greater contribution of \\nchanges in the CV towards changes in the PoU are \\nsomehow opposite for the 2022 value. Considering \\nthat estimates of the prevalence of severe food \\ninsecurity showed an improvement for many \\ncountries from 2021 to 2022, for those countries \\nwe project a reduction, rather than an increase \\nin CV|y. Combining the set of all lowest and the \\nset of all highest country estimates, we obtain, \\nrespectively, lower and upper bounds for the \\nglobal and regional series.

Methodology for the analysis of food \\ninsecurity by degree of urbanization and \\nby gender\\nThe prevalence of food insecurity can be \\ndisaggregated by respondent/household \\ncharacteristics when the data are collected \\ndirectly from individual respondents in nationally \\nrepresentative samples. In Chapter\\xa02 , food \\ninsecurity estimates are presented disaggregated \\nby sex of the respondent (adult men or women) \\nand by Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA) \\n(i.e.\\xa0urban, peri-urban or rural residency).\\nThe methodology to disaggregate the \\nindicator by any individual or household \\ncharacteristics is as follows:\\n \\x84 The cross-country comparable probability \\nof food insecurity for each respondent is \\ncomputed at two levels of severity: moderate \\nor severe, and severe only. The probabilities \\nare aggregated for each category of the \\ncharacteristic of interest, by computing the \\nweighted average (using sampling weights) \\nacross all respondents in that category, \\nobtaining the prevalence of food insecurity \\nwithin that group (for example, among \\nfemale respondents).\\n \\x84 The prevalence of food insecurity in a given \\ncategory is weighted by the corresponding \\npopulation (for example, the number of \\nfemale adults in the country) to obtain \\nthe subregional/regional/global estimate \\n(for\\xa0example, the prevalence of food insecurity \\nin the female adult population in Northern \\nAfrica), if reliable population data are available \\nand if there is sufficient geographical coverage \\nin terms of percentage of the population.\\nThe computation of the prevalence of food \\ninsecurity by sex is possible because data are \\ncollected from individual respondents (adults \\naged 15 years or older) by FAO via data collection \\nservice providers (see Annex \\xa01B). For countries \\nfor which national government survey data are \\nused to calculate the prevalence estimates of \\nfood insecurity (see Annex \\xa01B), it is generally \\nnot possible to disaggregate the indicator by \\nsex, as data are collected at the household \\nlevel. This year, for the first time, a protocol \\nwas developed to address this issue. Thus, in \\nsuch cases, the same relative difference by sex \\nestimated based on data collected by FAO is \\napplied to the prevalence of food insecurity in the \\ntotal population based on national data. This\\xa0is \\nan approximation, as the difference in the FAO \\ndata applies to adult respondents, and not to the \\nwhole population.

Then, these categories \\nwere mapped to the DEGURBA by considering \\npeople living in a rural area or on a farm as \\npart of the “rural” population, those living in a \\nsmall town or village as part of the “ peri -urban” \\npopulation and those living in a large city and \\nin the suburb of a large city as “urban” residents. \\nThis mapping was justified with the rationale \\nthat DEGURBA classifies areas with increasing \\nurbanization based on population density and \\nsize. To ensure that no significant bias was \\ninduced by this approach, the same mapping \\nwas validated as accurate for other Asian \\ncountries where data were collected in 2022. \\nD. Methodology for the cost and \\naffordability of a healthy diet\\nFAO with support from the World Bank Data \\nGroup systematically monitors the cost and \\naffordability of a healthy diet (CoAHD) indicators \\nand recently began to disseminate the updated \\nseries on the FAOSTAT database. 22 Estimates \\nare updated for 2021 (see sections below, \\nUpdating the cost of a healthy diet and Updating \\nthe affordability of a healthy diet ). In addition, \\nperiodic revisions of the entire data series are \\ncarried out by FAO to continuously improve the \\nmethodology and provide robust estimates on the \\nCoAHD indicators. \\nThe cost of a healthy diet \\nThe cost of a healthy diet is defined as the cost \\nof the least expensive locally available foods to \\nmeet requirements for energy and food-based \\ndietary guidelines (FBDGs) for a representative \\nperson within an energy balance of 2\\xa0330\\xa0kcal/\\nday. The FBDGs analysed explicitly recommend \\nfood quantities for each food group and provide \\na wide regional representation. Although it \\nis not selected based on nutrient content but \\nis determined by FBDGs, this diet meets on \\naverage nearly 95\\xa0percent of nutrient needs,\\xa0so \\nit can therefore almost always be considered as \\nnutrient adequate. \\nThe availability and prices of items in each food \\ngroup needed for a healthy diet were obtained \\nfrom the World Bank-led ICP as national averages \\nfor 2017 . Item definitions are internationally \\nstandardized, allowing classification by food \\ngroup and calculation of the least costs to reach \\nFBDG requirements in each country, representing \\nan average across markets and throughout the \\nyear.19 The cost of a healthy diet indicator is \\ncalculated using a standard basket, called the \\nHealthy Diet Basket, which consists of six food \\ngroups and reflects the commonalities across \\nten identified FBDGs.

(2020, 2022). 23, 24\\nAffordability of a healthy diet\\nIn this report, to determine affordability, \\nthe cost of a healthy diet is compared with \\ncountry-specific income distributions that are \\nderived from the World Bank’s PIP . 25 The resulting \\nmeasures of affordability include the percentage \\nand number of people unable to afford a healthy \\ndiet in a given country, in 2021. A healthy diet is \\nconsidered unaffordable when its cost exceeds \\n52\\xa0percent of the income in a country. This \\npercentage accounts for a portion of income \\nthat can be credibly reserved for food, based on \\nobservations that the population in low-income \\ncountries spend, on average, 52\\xa0percent of their \\nincome on food, as derived from the 2017 ICP \\nnational accounts household expenditure data. \\nBased on this threshold and comparing the cost \\nof the diet with country income distributions, we \\nobtain the percentage of people for whom the cost \\nof the diet is unaffordable. These proportions are \\nthen multiplied by the 2021 population in each \\ncountry using the world development indicators \\n(WDI) of the World Bank, 26 to obtain the number \\nof people unable to afford a healthy diet in a \\ngiven country.

This dataset tracks change in monthly \\ngeneral and food CPIs at the national level with \\nreference to a base year of 2015. The annual \\nCPIs are computed as simple averages of the \\n12 monthly CPIs within a year.

Of the 169 countries and \\nterritories with cost information in 2017 , the \\naffordability indicators were estimated for 143 \\nwith income distributions available in the PIP \\ndatabase.

To \\nupdate affordability in these years, distributions \\nin the PIP database were used for 78 of the \\n142\\xa0countries/territories in 2020, and for 27 in \\n2021. For the remaining ones (64 in 2020; 115 in \\n2021), affordability was estimated by the PIP \\nteam using projected distributions, 30 obtained by \\napplying the World Bank’s standard methods for \\nnowcasting poverty. 31 Finally, the proportion of \\npeople unable to afford a healthy diet, estimated \\nusing both methods, was multiplied by each \\ncountry /territory’s population using the WDI of \\nthe World Bank, to obtain the number of people \\nwho could not afford a healthy diet. The latest \\nestimates of the affordability indicators were \\nperformed on 26 April 2023. As the PIP database \\nis currently undergoing continuous updates of \\nincome distributions, affordability estimations \\nafter this date may marginally change.\\nIn this year’s edition, a revision of the \\nmethodology involves the affordability data \\nseries. Following the recent release of new PPP \\nfor 2017 , the World Bank adopted these latest \\nconversion factors to express its collection of \\nmonetary indicators in 2017 PPP terms, including \\nincome distributions in the PIP database. 25 It \\nimplies that the indicators of affordability are no \\nlonger expressed in 2011 PPP as in previous years \\nbut rather in 2017 PPP . Shifting the base year has \\nled to considerable variations in affordability \\nfor certain countries. Nonetheless, this change \\nis associated with improvements in the quality \\nof PPPs and better reflects the current economic \\nsituations worldwide. 32 Specifically, for seven \\ncountries, the share of people unable to afford \\na healthy diet was at least 7 percentage points \\nlower in 2021 when expressed in 2017 PPP \\ninstead of 2011 PPP (Angola, Plurinational State \\nof Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Sao Tome and \\nPrincipe, and Suriname). Conversely, it was 14 \\nand 7 percentage points higher in Ghana and \\nBelize, respectively. The World Bank has also \\nacknowledged large changes to the measure \\nof poverty rates for the same countries listed, \\nfollowing the adoption of 2017 PPP .

Progress was assessed against the \\n2030 nutrition targets established by UNICEF /\\nWHO34 and an adapted version of rules from the \\nWHO-UNICEF Technical Expert Advisory Group \\non Nutrition Monitoring 35 for all indicators where \\n2030 targets or progress assessment rules have not \\nbeen established. \\nTo determine which progress assessment \\ncategory to use for each indicator and each \\nregion, first, two distinct average annual rates \\nof reduction (AARR) bh were calculated: i) the \\nAARR required for the region to reach the 2030 \\ntarget; and ii) the actual AARR that the region \\nhas experienced to date. The value of the actual \\nAARR experienced to date is then used to \\ndetermine which progress assessment category \\nthe region is assigned, while also considering \\nthe required AARR. See Table \\xa0A2.4 for AARR \\nranges and prevalence thresholds applied for \\neach category and for each indicator, briefly:\\n \\x84 On track: regions with an actual AARR that is \\ngreater than the required AARR are categorized \\nas being “ on track” (green) to achieve the target. \\nA static threshold for the latest prevalence, \\nas noted for each indicator in Table\\xa0A2.4, is also \\nused to categorize regions as being “on track”; \\nfor example, any region for which the most \\nrecent overweight prevalence is below 3\\xa0percent \\nis considered “on track” , even if their actual \\nAARR is less than their required AARR. \\n \\x84 Off track: regions with an actual AARR \\nthat is less than the required AARR and for \\nwhich the latest prevalence is above the “on \\ntrack” static threshold noted in Table\\xa0A2.4 are \\nconsidered “off track”. The “off track” category \\nis broken down into different subcategories \\ndepending on the indicator.

For low birthweight and exclusive breastfeeding, the categories of “off track – no progress” and “off track – worsening” are combined into one \\ncategory of “off track – no progress or worsening” because there is insufficient variation in current progress to split these categories for these indicators.  \\n2. For exclusive breastfeeding, the actual target is to increase the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (under six months) to 70\\xa0percent by 2030; \\nhowever, it has been revised here to reflect the prevalence of non-exclusive breastfeeding so that the concept of the AARR can be applied as it is for the \\nother six targets.\\n3. The required AARR is based on the change in stunting prevalence corresponding to a 50\\xa0percent reduction in the number of children affected by \\nstunting between 2012 and 2030, considering the population growth estimated by the United Nations World Population Prospects . Actual AARR is \\ncalculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2022.\\n4. Regions considered on track are those where the stunting prevalence point estimate or the lower 95\\xa0percent confidence interval for 2022 is below \\n3\\xa0percent .\\n5. The required AARR is based on the required change in overweight or wasting prevalence to reduce from the baseline (2012) prevalence to 3\\xa0percent by \\n2030. Actual AARR is calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2022. Note that for wasting, unpublished trend estimates from the JME are used to \\ngenerate the actual AARR .\\n6. Regions where the overweight or wasting prevalence point estimate for 2022 is below 3\\xa0percent are considered on track .\\n7. The required AARR is based on the change required to reduce the low birthweight prevalence by 30\\xa0percent between 2012 (baseline year) and 2030. \\nThe same AARR of 1.96 is required for all regions since the target requires a relative change (reduction by 30\\xa0percent) in the baseline value. Actual AARR \\nis calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2020 .\\n8. Regions where the low birthweight prevalence point estimate for 2020 is below 5\\xa0percent are considered on track .\\n9. The required AARR is based on the required change to decrease the non-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence to 30\\xa0percent between 2012 (baseline \\nyear) and 2030. Actual AARR is calculated using only two estimates for the years of 2012 and 2021, where the regional averages are population weighted \\nusing the most recent estimate for each country between 2005 and 2012 for the 2012 estimate, and between 2016 to 2021 for the 2021 estimate .\\n10. Regions where the non-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence point estimate for 2021 is below 30\\xa0percent (i.e. where exclusive breastfeeding is \\n≥70\\xa0percent) are considered on track .\\n11. The global databases for the indicators of stunting, overweight and low birthweight are based on country-level models which provide annual estimates \\nfor all countries for generation of regional and global estimates (i.e. annual estimates are even available for countries without any household survey data, \\neven in cases where country-modelled estimates are not released to the public and used only for generation of global and regional estimates), thus \\nmaking progress assessment possible for all regions .\\n12. Progress assessment against the child stunting and child overweight targets is not conducted for countries which did not have any input data (e.g. \\nhousehold survey data) to use in the country model which were more recent than 2022, or for which modelled estimates remain pending final review . \\n13. Progress assessment is not possible for wasting for regions where population coverage is less than 50\\xa0percent. Population coverage is calculated by \\ndividing the sum of the population of children under five years for countries with at least one data point from household surveys between 1990 and 2020 \\nby the total population of children under five years for all countries in the region. Since wasting estimates are generated with a subregional model, even \\none year of data between 1990 and 2020 counts towards the regional population coverage .\\n14. Progress assessment against the child wasting target is not conducted for countries which do not have at least two data points (e.g. household \\nsurveys) between 2005 and 2022, with at least one point being more recent than 2012 .\\n15. Progress assessment is not possible for exclusive breastfeeding where the population coverage of country survey data for the region is less than \\n50\\xa0percent for the 2012 and/or the 2021 estimate. For 2012, population coverage is calculated by dividing the sum of the population of children under \\nfive years for countries with at least one data point from household surveys between 2005 and 2012 by the total population of children under five years \\nfor all countries in the region. For 2021, population coverage is calculated by dividing the sum of the population of children under five years for countries \\nwith at least one data point from household surveys between 2016 and 2021 .\\nSOURCE: Elaborated using information from: WHO & UNICEF. 2017.

URCA data definitions and framework\\nThe Urban Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) is a \\npublicly available global geospatial dataset which \\nprovides a global mapping of the rural–urban \\ncontinuum. 36,\\xa037  It is based on the Global Human \\nSettlement Layer 21 and places urban centres on \\na gradient based on population size and density. \\nAs\\xa0shown in Chapter \\xa03 (Figure\\xa0A  of Box\\xa02) rural \\nlocations are assigned a gradient of their own, \\nusing the shortest travel time to urban centres of \\nvarious sizes. Thus, the URCA disaggregates rural \\nareas into multiple categories, distinguishing, \\nfor example, between locations that are less than \\n1 hour from an urban centre and those that are \\nfarther away. In Chapter \\xa04, the URCA dataset is \\ncombined with household survey data for the \\ncountry case studies. \\nThe URCA approach builds upon the central \\nplace theory, which is a set of assumptions and \\npropositions that explain why hierarchically \\ntiered centres are found at certain favoured \\nlocations on the economic landscape. For \\nexample, retail trade and service activities often \\ntend to cluster. The URCA approach assumes that \\ncity size is a proxy for the breadth of services \\nand opportunities provided by an urban centre. \\nIt uses travel time to locations as a proxy for \\ncost and adopts an urban hierarchy based on \\ncity size to classify rural locations as gravitating \\naround a specific urban centre. This approach \\nallows for: i)\\xa0capturing the urban hierarchy that \\nexists between urban centres of different sizes \\nin terms of access to services and employment \\nopportunities for rural locations; ii)\\xa0defining \\nurban–rural catchment areas (URCAs) in terms \\nof the interconnection between urban centres \\n(of different sizes) and their surrounding rural \\nANNEX 4 \\nDATA AND DEFINITIONS \\nFOR CHAPTER 3\\nareas; and iii)\\xa0adopting a gridded approach that \\nis easily comparable across countries, developing \\na dataset for the whole world. \\nAdditionally, the URCA approach allows for the \\nidentification of the share of the population that \\nfalls in a specific category of the rural–urban \\ncontinuum within an administrative unit, rather \\nthan placing all the population in one territory \\nor functional area. This categorization allows for \\nmore detailed analyses regarding consumption \\nand production across the continuum. Table\\xa0A4.1 \\ndescribes the basic urban URCA categories; \\nconsequently, different categories of rural are \\nattributed to urban areas of different sizes, \\ne.g.\\xa0rural areas less than 1\\xa0hour travel to a city of \\nmore than 5\\xa0million people.\\nIn defining the rural URCA categories based on \\ntravel time to an urban agglomerations, the time \\ninterval is to be considered as a closed interval on \\nthe right. In particular, for the URCA categories \\nused in the report it means that:\\n \\x84 “ <1 hour” to any urban centre includes areas \\nlocated 1 hour or less to a city of any size or \\ntown: areas ≤1 hour.\\n \\x84 “1–2 hours” to any urban centre includes \\nareas located more than 1 hour but less or \\nequal to 2\\xa0hours to a city of any size or town: \\n1\\xa0hour\\xa0< area ≤2 hours.\\n \\x84 “>2 hours” to any urban centre includes areas \\nlocated more than 2 hour to a city of any size or \\ntown: areas >2 hours.\\nNote that for improved readability of the text and \\nfigures in Chapter 4 , this degree of specificity \\napplies, but is not written at this level of detail.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 243, 'page_label': '214'}, page_content='ANNEX 4\\n| 214 |\\nB. Methodological approach and tool for \\nthe systematic structural literature review\\nThe systematic review of evidence from scientific \\nstudies used for Chapter 3 , designed following the \\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews \\nand Meta-analysis (PRISMA), 4 was implemented \\nusing an integrated research tool, Expert Search \\nSemantic ENriChmEnt (Essence), developed by \\nthe FAO Data Lab. \\nEssence is based on a web application that offers \\nthe possibility of automatically querying scientific \\narticles from multiple data sources (Google \\nScholar, World Bank, International Monetary \\nFund, etc.). These articles, including their full text, \\nare then stored and made available for review \\nthrough a semantic search engine utilizing the \\nApache Solr database at its core. This allows \\nfor the aggregation and filtering of results by \\nselecting values automatically identified when \\nthe documents are downloaded or by exploiting \\nannotations added collaboratively. \\nAdvanced methods were used from the tool’s \\nweb interface, which permitted the filtering of \\ndownloaded documents through an algorithm \\nbased on an artificial intelligence method that \\nlearns and extends user selections of relevant \\narticles. The approach relies on the manual \\nrevision of a small subset of documents that are \\nidentified as relevant, or not, by the users to be \\nused as a source of ground truth. A preliminary \\ntext pre-processing and learning step was then \\nexecuted directly from the web interface, in \\norder to estimate and generalize the linking \\nfunction between the content (i.e. terms) of \\nthe reviewed documents and their relevance \\nstatus. The learning step was based on linear \\nlogistic regression, which is a classification \\nalgorithm used to solve binary classification \\nproblems. The\\xa0logistic regression classifier uses \\na weighted combination of the input features \\n(the terms in the Tf-idf matrix) and passes them \\nthrough a sigmoid function that transforms \\nany real number input to a number between 0 \\nand 1. The\\xa0weights of the combinations are then \\nestimated to minimize the distance between \\nthe output of the function and the user’s \\nspecification of the relevance of the reviewed \\ndocuments. After this step, the resulting \\nfunction was applied to all the documents that \\nwere downloaded (and also those not reviewed), \\nwhich were associated to a “score of relevance.” \\nA threshold made it possible to classify all \\nthe documents that were downloaded and not \\nmanually reviewed as “relevant”. \\nThrough this iterative process, it was possible to \\nrevise the literature in few passages and rely on \\nthe features available directly from the Essence \\nWeb interface. This is because the proposed \\nrelevance score for the non-user-evaluated \\ndocuments becomes a filter, permitting users \\nto quickly identify and review the most likely \\nrelevant documents and add new examples that \\ncould help the algorithm to better identify those \\nthat are relevant to the set of documents used \\nin the learning step. This iterative process helps \\nusers filter out the most relevant documents \\nand helps improve the accuracy of the model so \\nthat it is better able to make predictions on the \\nrelevance of a document.\\nFor a full description of the implementation of \\nthe PRISMA protocol, and the methodological \\napproach for the systematic structural literature \\nreview, see de Bruin and Holleman (2023). 18 n\\nRURAL URBAN\\nHours travel time to one of seven urban \\nagglomerations\\nAgglomerations based on population size\\n>3  \\nhours*\\n3–2  \\nhours\\n2–1  \\nhours\\n<1  \\nhour\\n>5  \\nmillion \\npeople\\n1–5  \\nmillion \\npeople\\n0.5–1 \\nmillion \\npeople\\n250–500 \\nthousand \\npeople\\n100–250 \\nthousand \\npeople\\n50–100 \\nthousand \\npeople\\n20–50 \\nthousand \\npeople\\nNOTE: * Considered as either hinterland or dispersed towns, being that they do not gravitate around any urban agglomeration, and are hence not \\npart of the rural–urban  continuum .\\nSOURCE: FAO. 2021.

Household surveys\\nThe demand analysis conducted in Section\\xa04.1  \\nand the estimation of subnational cost of a healthy \\ndiet in Section 4.2  use georeferenced data from \\nnational representative LSMS surveys ( Table\\xa0A5.1). \\nThe surveys capture apparent household food \\nconsumption using quantitative seven-day recalls. \\nThe same surveys contain a separate module \\nwith eight questions regarding people’s access to \\nadequate food, which was used for the estimation \\nof the prevalence of moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity in Section\\xa04.2.  \\nFinally, malnutrition indicators among children \\nunder five\\xa0years of age assessed in Section\\xa04.2  \\nwere derived using georeferenced data from \\nnational representative demographic and health \\nsurveys ( Table\\xa0A5.1).\\nB. URCA categories used in the  \\nrural–urban continuum analysis\\nFor the analyses conducted in Chapter\\xa04 , the \\nURCA categories were simplified and grouped \\ninto ten\\xa0categories, with a further aggregation to \\nurban, peri-urban and rural categories (see Table\\xa09 \\nin Chapter\\xa04 ). This aggregation allowed for a \\nsufficient number of observations in almost \\nANNEX 5\\nDATA AND DEFINITIONS  \\nFOR CHAPTER 4 \\nall URCAs to conduct the analyses. For more \\ndetails on the URCA categories, see Box\\xa02 and\\xa0 Box\\xa03 \\nin Chapter\\xa03 . Table\\xa0A5.2 reports the number of \\nhouseholds interviewed in each URCA and the \\nnumber of households for which georeferenced \\nvariables were not available, and for which it was \\nthus not possible to assign to any URCA.\\nThe surveys are all nationally representative, \\nbut they are not meant to be representative at \\nthe URCA level. For this reason, the distribution \\nof population surveyed across URCAs was \\ncompared with the actual population distribution \\n(estimated based on the 2020 Global Human \\nSettlement Population [GHS-POP] dataset and the \\nURCA dataset), and it was found to be sufficiently \\nsimilar so as to exclude that any catchment area \\nwas under- or overrepresented in each survey. \\nThe URCA dataset was developed based on \\ni)\\xa0the GHS Settlement Model (GHS-SMOD) grid \\nto identify cities and towns; ii)\\xa0the GHS-POP \\ngrid for 2015 to calculate the urban population \\nin each city; and iii)\\xa0travel time classifications \\nbased on Nelson et al .

However, the \\ninformation on road and infrastructure used in \\nthe URCA dataset was the most updated at the \\ntime the dataset was developed, which is around \\nthe same time the surveys were conducted. \\nThus, we expect that the travel time in the URCA \\ndataset does not diverge significantly from \\nthe travel time faced by the households in the \\nsurveys analysed.\\nTo identify the urban centres in the URCA \\ndataset, the 2015 GHS-POP was used. Accordingly, \\nit is possible that some peri-urban areas are \\nmisclassified in the analysis of Chapter 4  (i.e.\\xa0if \\na city has expanded, some areas that were in \\n2015 classified as “less than 1\\xa0hour from the \\ncity” could have become part of the city in \\n2018/19). This is however only the case if the \\ncity had expanded geographically and not just \\nin population size. In addition, it is possible that \\nan urban centre may have grown in population \\nsize between 2015 and 2018/19 and made the \\njump from small to intermediate city, or from \\nintermediate to large city.\\nC.

Unprocessed and \\nminimally processed \\nfoods\\nUnprocessed foods are of plant origin (leaves, stems, roots, \\ntubers, fruits, nuts, seeds), or animal origin (meat, other \\nflesh, tissue and organs, eggs, milk), consumed shortly after \\nharvesting, gathering, slaughter or husbanding. Minimally \\nprocessed foods are unprocessed foods altered in ways that \\ndo not add or introduce any substance, but that may involve \\nsubtracting parts of the food. Minimal processes include \\ncleaning, scrubbing, washing; winnowing, hulling, peeling, \\ngrinding, grating, squeezing, flaking; skinning, boning, \\ncarving, portioning, scaling, filleting; pressing; drying, \\nskimming, fat reduction; pasteurizing, sterilizing; chilling, \\nrefrigerating, freezing; sealing, bottling (as such); simple \\nwrapping, vacuum- and gas-packing. Malting, which adds \\nwater, is a minimal process, as is fermenting, which adds \\nliving organisms, when it does not generate alcohol.\\nThe main aim of these processes is to extend the life of \\nunprocessed foods, enabling their storage for longer use,  \\nor to make them edible, and, often, to make their \\npreparation easier or more diverse.\\nFresh, chilled, frozen, vacuum-packed \\nvegetables and fruits; grains (cereals) \\nincluding all types of rice; fresh, frozen and \\ndried beans and other legumes (pulses), \\nroots and tubers; fungi; dried fruits and \\nfreshly prepared or pasteurized non-\\nreconstituted fruit juices; unsalted nuts and \\nseeds; fresh, dried, chilled, frozen meats, \\npoultry, fish, seafood; dried, fresh, \\npasteurized full-fat, low-fat, skimmed milk, \\nfermented milk such as plain yoghurt; eggs; \\nflours, “raw” pastas made from flour and \\nwater, teas, coffee, herb infusions; tap, \\nfiltered, spring, mineral water. Also includes \\nfoods made from two or more items in this \\ngroup, such as dried mixed fruits, granola \\nmade from cereals, nuts and dried fruits \\nwith no added sugars, honey or oils; pasta, \\ncouscous and polenta made with flours, \\nflakes or grits and water; and foods with \\nvitamins and minerals added generally to \\nreplace nutrients lost during processing, \\nsuch as wheat or cornflour fortified with \\niron and folic acid.\\n2. Processed culinary \\ningredients\\nProcessed culinary ingredients are food products extracted \\nand purified by industry from constituents of foods, or else \\nobtained from nature, such as salt. Stabilizing or “purifying” \\nagents and other additives may also be used. They may \\ncontain additives that prolong product duration, protect \\noriginal properties or prevent proliferation of \\nmicroorganisms.\\nVegetable oils crushed from seeds, nuts or \\nfruits (notably olives); butter and lard \\nobtained from milk and pork; sugar and \\nmolasses obtained from cane or beet; \\nhoney extracted from combs and syrup \\nfrom maple trees; starches extracted from \\ncorn and other plants, and salt mined or \\nfrom seawater, vegetable oils with added \\nantioxidants, and table salt with added \\ndrying agents. Includes products consisting \\nof two group 2 items, such as salted butter, \\nand group 2 items with added vitamins or \\nminerals, such as iodized salt.\\n3. Processed foods These foods are manufactured by adding salt or sugars \\n(or\\xa0other substance of culinary use such as oils or vinegar) to \\nwhole foods, to make them more durable and sometimes \\nalso to modify their palatability. They are directly derived \\nfrom foods and recognizable as versions of the original \\nfoods. They are generally produced to be consumed as part \\nof meals or dishes, or may be used, together with highly \\nprocessed products, to replace food-based freshly prepared \\ndishes and meals. Processes include canning and bottling \\nusing oils, sugars or salt, and methods of preservation such \\nas salting, salt pickling, smoking, curing. Processes and \\ningredients here are designed to increase the durability of \\ngroup\\xa01 foods and make them more enjoyable by modifying \\nor enhancing their sensory qualities. They may contain \\nadditives that prolong product duration, protect original \\nproperties, or prevent proliferation of microorganisms. When \\nalcoholic drinks are identified as foods, those produced by \\nfermentation of group\\xa01 foods such as beer, cider and wine, \\nare classified here in group\\xa03.\\nCanned or bottled vegetables and legumes \\n(pulses) preserved in brine; peeled or sliced \\nfruits preserved in syrup; tinned whole or \\npieces of fish preserved in oil; salted nuts; \\nun-reconstituted processed meat and fish \\nsuch as ham, bacon, smoked fish; cheese; \\nand fresh unpackaged breads when made \\nfrom wheat flour (or other cereal flours), \\nwater, ferments and salt.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 248, 'page_label': '219'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023\\n| 219 |\\nNOV A classification compared with the current \\nepidemiologic approach, which relies on the \\nlinkage of nutrient intakes to chronic disease, \\nwith subsequent identification of foods that \\nmerit consideration in public health nutrition \\nstrategies. 44 Therefore, results presented in \\nChapter\\xa04 should be interpreted with these \\nlimitations and considerations in mind.\\nFood processing and food group classifications  \\nused in Section 4.1\\nThe NOV A classification system was developed \\nby researchers from the University of São Paulo, \\nBrazil. 45 The system was published more than \\nten\\xa0years ago and has been used in different \\nsettings and populations since. 46 For the food \\ndemand analyses by level of food processing, a \\nfood classification system adapted from NOV A \\nwas used, whereby all foods were classified \\naccording to the nature, extent and purpose \\nof the industrial processing they undergo. \\nThese processes involve physical, biological \\nand/or chemical methods used during the food \\nmanufacturing process. 41,\\xa045\\nAccording to the NOV A classification, methods used \\nin households and similar places such as restaurants \\nor artisanal settings where fresh culinary \\npreparations are prepared from scratch by hand or \\nwith simple tools, are by definition not industrial \\nprocessing methods. Home-prepared and artisanal \\npreparations of all types should as far as possible \\nbe disaggregated into their components so that each \\ncan then be classified into one of the four groups. \\nNOV A classifies all food items into four main \\ngroups: 1)\\xa0unprocessed and minimally processed \\nfoods; 2)\\xa0processed culinary ingredients; \\n3)\\xa0processed foods; and 4)\\xa0highly processed \\nfoods and drink products. 45,\\xa046  The four main \\nNOVA food group Description Examples\\n4. Ultra-processed \\nfoods and drink \\nproducts\\nThese products are formulated mostly or entirely from \\nsubstances derived from foods or other organic sources, \\nand typically contain little or no whole foods. They are \\ndurable, convenient, accessible, highly or ultra-palatable, \\nand often habit-forming. These foods are typically not \\nrecognizable as versions of foods, although may imitate the \\nappearance, shape and sensory qualities of foods. Many \\ningredients are not available in retail outlets. Some \\ningredients are directly derived from foods, such as oils, \\nfats, flours, starches and sugars; others are obtained by \\nfurther processing of food constituents or synthesized from \\nother organic sources. Numerically the majority of \\ningredients are preservatives; stabilizers, emulsifiers, \\nsolvents, binders, bulkers; sweeteners, sensory enhancers, \\ncolours and flavours; processing aids and other additives; \\nbulk may come from added air or water. Micronutrients may \\n“fortify” the products. Most are designed to be consumed \\nby themselves or in combination as snacks. Processes \\ninclude hydrogenation, hydrolysis; extruding, moulding, \\nre-shaping; pre-processing by frying, baking. Processes and \\ningredients used to manufacture highly processed foods are \\ndesigned to create highly profitable products (low-cost \\ningredients, long shelf-life, emphatic branding), \\nconvenience (ready-to-consume) hyper-palatable products \\nliable to displace freshly prepared dishes and meals made \\nfrom all other NOVA food groups. When alcoholic drinks are \\nidentified as foods, those produced by fermentation of \\ngroup 1 foods followed by distillation of the resulting \\nalcohol, such as whisky, gin, rum, vodka, are classified here \\nin group 4.\\nChips (crisps), many types of sweet, fatty or \\nsalty snack products; ice cream, \\nchocolates, candies (confectionery); \\nFrench fries (chips), burgers and hot dogs; \\npoultry and fish “nuggets” or “sticks” \\n(“fingers”); mass manufactured breads, \\nbuns, cookies (biscuits); breakfast cereals; \\npastries, cakes, cake mixes; “energy” bars; \\npreserves (jams); margarines; desserts; \\ncanned, bottled, dehydrated, packaged \\nsoups, noodles; sauces; meat, yeast \\nextracts; soft, carbonated, cola, “energy” \\ndrinks; sugared, sweetened milk drinks, \\ncondensed milk, sweetened including \\n“fruit” yoghurts; fruit and “fruit nectar” \\ndrinks; instant coffee, cocoa drinks; \\nno-alcohol wine or beer; pre-prepared \\nmeat, fish, vegetable, cheese, pizza, pasta \\ndishes; infant formulas, follow-on milks, \\nother baby products; “health”, “slimming” \\nproducts such as powdered or “fortified” \\nmeal and dish substitutes.\\nSOURCES: Monteiro C.A., Cannon, G., Levy, R.B., Moubarac, J-C., Iouzada, M.L.C., Rauber, F., Khandpur, N., Cediel, G.

For simplicity of presentation, a \\nnumber of the food groups were combined into \\nbroader groups. For instance, the group “staple \\nfoods” includes the subgroups “cereals and \\ntheir products” and “roots, tubers, plantains \\nand their products”. The group “animal source \\nfoods” is composed of the subgroups “milk \\nand milk products” , “eggs and their products” , \\n“fish, shellfish and their products” , “meat and \\nmeat products” and “insects, grubs and their \\nproducts” and so forth. The group “sweets, \\ncondiments and beverages” is composed of the \\nsubgroups “sweets and sugars” , “spices and \\ncondiments” and “beverages”. “Food away from \\nhome” comprises prepared foods consumed \\naway from home, which is specifically identified \\nin household surveys.

Stability – If the dimensions of availability, \\naccess and utilization are sufficiently met, \\nstability is the condition in which the whole \\nsystem is stable, thus ensuring that households \\nare food secure at all times. Stability issues \\ncan refer to short-term instability (which can \\nlead to acute food insecurity) or medium- \\nto long-term instability (which can lead to \\nchronic food insecurity). Climatic, economic, \\nsocial and political factors can all be a source \\nof instability. \\nThe report also refers to two additional \\ndimensions of food security that are proposed \\nby the High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) of \\nthe Committee on World Food Security (CFS); \\nhowever, they are not formally agreed upon \\nby FAO or others, and there is not a negotiated \\nagreed upon language. However, due to their \\nrelevance in the context of this report, they are \\nincluded here. These two additional dimensions \\nof food security are reinforced in conceptual and \\nlegal understandings of the right to food and are \\ncurrently referred to and defined as follows: \\ne. Agency refers to the capacity of individuals \\nor groups to make their own decisions about \\nwhat foods they eat; what foods they produce; \\nhow that food is produced, processed and \\ndistributed within food systems; and their \\nability to engage in processes that shape food \\nsystem policies and governance. 64\\nf. Sustainability refers to the long-term ability \\nof food systems to provide food security and \\nnutrition in a way that does not compromise \\nthe economic, social and environmental bases \\nthat generate food security and nutrition for \\nfuture generations. 64 \\nGeneral services support (GSS)\\nRefers to public expenditure (or budget transfers) \\nfor the provision of public or collective goods \\nand services that aim to create enabling and \\nenvironmentally sustainable conditions for \\nthe food and agriculture sector. These services \\nconnect all economic actors of food supply \\nchains and support the nexus between producers \\nand consumers. The most common include \\nresearch and development and knowledge \\ntransfer, inspection services, agricultural related \\ninfrastructure, public stockholding, and food and \\nagricultural marketing, and promotion. \\nGovernance\\xa0\\nGovernance refers to formal and informal rules, \\norganizations, and processes through which \\npublic and private actors articulate their interests \\nand make and implement decisions. 65\\nHazard\\nA process, phenomenon or human activity that \\nmay cause loss of life, injury or other health \\nimpacts, property damage, social and economic \\ndisruption or environmental degradation. 66 \\nHealthcare\\nThe organized provision of medical care to \\nindividuals or a community.

It thus refers to a lack \\nof consistent access to food, which diminishes \\ndietary quality, disrupts normal eating patterns, \\nand can have negative consequences for nutrition, \\nhealth and well-being. \\nNutrition transition\\nAs incomes rise and populations become more \\nurban, diets high in complex carbohydrates and \\nfibre give way to more energy-dense diets high \\nin fats, sugars and/or salt. These global dietary \\ntrends are accompanied by a demographic \\ntransition with a shift towards increased life \\nexpectancy and reduced fertility rates.

In nutritious foods, the presence \\nof nutrients of public health concern including \\nsaturated fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium is \\nminimized, industrially produced trans fats are \\neliminated, and salt is iodized.\\nOverweight and obesity\\nDefined as body weight that is above normal for \\nheight as a result of an excessive accumulation of \\nfat. It is usually a manifestation of expending less \\nenergy than is consumed. In adults, overweight is \\ndefined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25\\xa0kg/m 2 or \\nmore, and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or more. \\nIn children under five years of age, overweight \\nis defined as weight-for-height greater than 2 \\nstandard deviations above the WHO Child Growth \\nStandards median, and obesity as weight-for-height \\ngreater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO \\nChild Growth Standards median. 67 \\nPrevalence of undernourishment (PoU)\\nAn estimate of the proportion of the population \\nthat lacks enough dietary energy for a healthy, \\nactive life.

Risk \\nto food insecurity is the probability of food \\ninsecurity resulting from interactions between a \\nnatural or human-induced hazard/shock/stress \\nand vulnerable conditions.\\nRural–urban continuum\\nRepresents a different way of examining \\nrural–urban spatial relationships across a \\ncontinuum, rather than the more conventional \\nrural/urban distinction. The rural–urban \\ncontinuum views rural and urban areas not as \\nseparate spaces, but as two ends of a spectrum of \\nsettlements and catchment areas of different sizes \\nand their linkages. \\nSevere food insecurity\\nThe level of severity of food insecurity at which \\npeople have likely run out of food, experienced \\nhunger and, at the most extreme, gone for \\ndays without eating, putting their health and \\nwell-being at grave risk, based on the Food \\nInsecurity Experience Scale. \\nStaple foods\\nStaple foods are those eaten regularly, and in \\nsuch quantities as to constitute the dominant \\npart of the diet and supply a major proportion \\nof total dietary energy. The main kinds of staple \\nfoods are cereals (e.g.\\xa0rice, maize, wheat, rye, \\nbarley, oats, millet, sorghum),\\xa0roots and tubers \\n(e.g.\\xa0potatoes, cassava, yams) and legumes \\n(e.g.\\xa0beans, lentils, soybean). 55\\nStructural transformation\\nThe theory of structural transformation describes \\nthe transformation of economies, initiated with an \\nincrease in agricultural productivity in rural areas \\nleading to an agricultural surplus. The additional \\nincome from this surplus then generates demand \\nfor other goods and services stimulating the \\noff-farm sectors of the economy. As a result, a \\ngradual shift of jobs from the primary agriculture \\nsector to the secondary and tertiary sectors takes \\nplace, typically located in urban areas. This \\nencourages rural-to-urban migration, resulting \\nin an economic transformation from a mainly \\nagrarian to a more diversified national economy, \\nattracting rural people to urban areas. 69'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2023-07-11T09:33:55+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2023-07-12T11:25:47+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 316, 'page': 279, 'page_label': '250'}, page_content='ANNEX 11\\n| 250 |\\nStunting\\nLow height-for-age, reflecting a past episode or \\nepisodes of sustained undernutrition.

NUTRITION IN THE WORLD\\nTHE STATE OF \\nURBANIZATION, AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS \\nTRANSFORMATION AND HEALTHY DIETS \\nACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM\\nThis report provides an update on global progress towards the targets of ending hunger (SDG Target 2.1) \\nand all forms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2). It shows that hunger at the global level remained \\nrelatively stable between 2021 and 2022, but is still far above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels and is \\nalso rising in many places where people are still struggling to recover income losses in the wake of the \\npandemic or have been affected by increasing prices of food, agricultural inputs and energy, conflicts \\nand/or extreme climate events. The report also provides updated estimates on the billions of people who \\nare unable to access nutritious, safe and sufficient food all year round. Overall, the report shows that we \\nare far off track to meet all nutrition targets. While progress on important indicators of child nutrition is \\nrevealed, rising overweight among children under five years of age in many countries portends growing \\nburdens of non-communicable diseases.\\nSince its 2017 edition, this report has repeatedly highlighted that the intensification and interaction of \\nconflict, climate extremes and economic slowdowns and downturns, combined with highly unaffordable \\nnutritious foods and growing inequality, are pushing us off track to meet the SDG 2 targets. However, \\nother important megatrends must also be factored into the analysis to fully understand the challenges to \\nand opportunities for meeting the SDG 2 targets. One such megatrend, and the focus of this year’s \\nreport, is urbanization.\\nUrbanization is increasing in many countries and this report shows it is changing agrifood systems in \\nways we can no longer understand using the simple rural–urban divide. The changing pattern of \\npopulation agglomerations across a rural–urban continuum and its interface as a place of exchange and \\nsocioeconomic interactions, is reshaping and being reshaped by agrifood systems, with implications for \\nthe availability and affordability of healthy diets, and in turn, for food security and nutrition.  \\nNew evidence shows that food purchases in some countries are no longer high only among urban \\nhouseholds but also among rural households. Consumption of highly processed foods is also increasing \\nin peri-urban and rural areas of some countries. These changes are affecting people’s food security and \\nnutrition in ways that differ depending on where they live across the rural–urban continuum.\\nThis timely and relevant theme is aligned with the United Nations General Assembly-endorsed New \\nUrban Agenda, and the report provides recommendations on the policies, investments and actions \\nneeded to address the challenges of agrifood systems transformation under urbanization and to enable \\nopportunities for ensuring access to affordable healthy diets for everyone.\\n2023'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 0, 'page_label': 'cover'}, page_content='FOOD SECURITY  AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD\\nTHE STATE OF \\nFINANCING TO END HUNGER, \\nFOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION \\nIN ALL ITS FORMS\\n2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 1, 'page_label': 'copyright/disclaimer'}, page_content='INDIA.

We are encouraged by the \\ncommitment of national governments, partners \\nall over the world and the global community \\ntowards this common goal.\\nWhile we have made some progress, \\nimprovements have been uneven and insufficient. \\nWe have seen improvement in more populous \\ncountries with growing economies, but hunger, \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition continue to \\nincrease in many countries around the world. \\nThis is affecting millions of people especially \\nin rural areas, where extreme poverty and food \\ninsecurity remain deeply entrenched. Vulnerable \\npopulations, particularly women, youth and \\nIndigenous Peoples, are disproportionately \\naffected. A continuation of the past trends \\nmeans that by 2030, millions of people will still \\nbe undernourished, millions of children will \\nstill be affected by malnutrition in its different \\nforms, and the world will still be falling short of \\nreaching the global nutrition targets. \\nConflict, climate variability and extremes, \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns, lack of \\naccess to and unaffordability of healthy diets, \\nunhealthy food environments, and high and \\npersistent inequality continue to drive food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition all over the world. \\nThe policies and investments needed to transform \\nagrifood systems and address these drivers along \\nthe rural–urban continuum have been identified \\nin previous editions of The State of Food Security \\nand Nutrition in the World . In preparing for this \\nyear’s report, we wanted to address the reasons \\nwhy such policies and investments have not been \\nimplemented at scale. \\nA central reason is finance and financial \\ninclusion, which are among the means of \\nimplementation of the SDGs and need more \\nconsistent political commitment. The countries \\nwith the highest levels of food insecurity and \\nmultiple forms of malnutrition, and affected \\nby the major drivers of these problems, are the \\ncountries with the least access to financing.\\nOur five organizations are committed to taking \\ncomprehensive stock of how much financing \\nfor food security and nutrition is available \\nglobally, and how much more is needed to \\nsupport the policies and investments necessary \\nto address all the causes and the major drivers \\nof food insecurity and malnutrition along the \\nrural–urban continuum. This report provides \\na definition of financing for food security \\nand nutrition and the guidance to implement \\nit. To support such implementation, our five \\norganizations commit to advocate for, and \\nsupport, data development for a better global \\naccounting system of financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nEstimating the gap in financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition and mobilizing \\ninnovative ways of financing to bridge it must \\nbe among our top priorities. Policies, legislation \\nand interventions to end hunger and ensure \\nall people have access to safe, nutritious and \\nsufficient food (SDG Target\\xa02.1), and to end all \\nforms of malnutrition (SDG Target\\xa02.2) need \\nsignificant resource mobilization. They are \\nnot only an investment in the future, but our \\nobligation. We strive to guarantee the right \\nto adequate food and nutrition of current and \\nfuture generations. \\n| vii |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 9, 'page_label': 'viii'}, page_content='FOREWORD\\nQu Dongyu\\nFAO Director-General\\nAlvaro Lario\\nIFAD President\\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\\nWHO Director-General\\nCatherine Russell\\nUNICEF Executive Director\\nIn the run-up to the Summit of the Future 2024, \\nand the Fourth International Conference on \\nFinancing for Development in 2025, the theme of \\nthis year’s report is particularly timely.

The world is still far off track to achieve Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger, with the global \\nprevalence of undernourishment persisting at nearly \\nthe same level for three consecutive years after having \\nrisen sharply in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nBetween 713 and 757 million people may have faced \\nhunger in 2023 – one out of 11 people in the world, \\nand one out of every five in Africa.

In 2023, an estimated \\n28.9\\xa0percent of the global population – 2.33 billion \\npeople – were moderately or severely food insecure.\\nè Focusing on economic access to nutritious \\nfoods, updated and improved estimates show that \\nmore than one-third of people in the world – about \\n2.8 billion – could not afford a healthy diet in 2022. \\nInequalities are evident, with low-income countries \\nhaving the largest percentage of the population that is \\nunable to afford a healthy diet (71.5 percent) compared \\nwith lower-middle-income countries (52.6 percent), \\nupper-middle-income countries (21.5 percent) and \\nhigh-income countries (6.3\\xa0percent).\\nè The lack of improvement in food security and the \\nuneven progress in the economic access to healthy \\ndiets cast a shadow over the possibility of achieving \\nZero Hunger in the world, six years away from the 2030 \\ndeadline. It is projected that 582 million people will be \\nchronically undernourished at the end of the decade, \\nmore than half of them in Africa. There is the need to \\naccelerate the transformation of our agrifood systems \\nto strengthen their resilience to the major drivers and \\naddress inequalities to ensure that healthy diets are \\naffordable for and available to all. \\nè There has been some progress towards the goal of \\nending all forms of malnutrition, with improvements in \\nthe global prevalence of stunting and wasting among \\nchildren under five years of age and of exclusive \\nbreastfeeding among infants under six months of age. \\nThe global prevalence of low birthweight and that \\nof childhood overweight have been stagnant, while \\nanaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years has increased. \\nThe world is not on track to reach any of the seven global \\nnutrition targets by\\xa02030.\\nè Improvements in stunting, wasting and exclusive \\nbreastfeeding lay the groundwork for children to \\nachieve their full potential for growth and development, \\nbut rising rates of obesity – exacerbating the double \\nburden of malnutrition – foreshadow major challenges \\nfor the health and well-being of all age groups. \\nDouble-duty actions are needed which simultaneously \\ntackle undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, \\noverweight and obesity by leveraging the common \\ndrivers shared by all forms of malnutrition.\\nè Meeting SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 to end hunger, \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition requires increased and \\nmore cost-effective financing, but there is currently \\nno clear picture of the financing for food security and \\nnutrition – neither that available nor that additionally \\nneeded – for meeting these targets.\\nè The wide range of definitions of financing for \\nfood security and nutrition, and the differences \\namong them, lead to inconsistent estimates, causing \\nissues in identifying underfinanced areas, ensuring \\naccountability, and tracking intervention impacts. \\nTherefore, both a common definition and mapping of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition are urgently \\nneeded, as current efforts lack adequate attention \\nand\\xa0clarity. \\nè This report defines financing for food security \\nand nutrition as the public and private financial \\nresources, both domestic and foreign, that are directed \\ntowards eradicating hunger, food insecurity and all \\nforms of malnutrition.\\xa0They are targeted to ensure \\nthe availability, access, utilization and stability of \\nnutritious and safe foods, and practices that favour \\nhealthy diets, as well as health, education and social \\nprotection services that enable these, and they include \\nthe financial resources that are directed towards \\nstrengthening the resilience of agrifood systems to \\nthe major drivers and underlying structural factors of \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. \\n| xvi |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 18, 'page_label': 'xvii'}, page_content='è The universal adoption of a new definition and a \\nstandardized approach to mapping financing flows \\noriented to meet SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 – as provided \\nin this report – must capture the multidimensional \\nnature of food security and nutrition, shifting away from \\nthe typical sector-defined boundaries that are common \\nto these definitions.\\nè A robust number for the total financing available and \\nadditionally needed to support all the efforts towards \\nmeeting SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 is not yet quantifiable. \\nFinancing for food security and nutrition is mostly \\ntrackable for public and official flows, but not for several \\nprivate\\xa0flows.\\nè Public spending on food security and nutrition \\nmostly targets food consumption, especially to support \\nfood availability and access, based on data for ten \\nlow- and middle-income countries.

After rising sharply \\nfrom 2019 to 2021, the proportion of the world \\npopulation facing hunger persisted at virtually \\nthe same level for three consecutive years, \\nwith\\xa0the latest estimates indicating a global PoU \\nof 9.1\\xa0percent in 2023. In terms of population, \\nbetween 713 and 757\\xa0million people (8.9 and \\n9.4\\xa0percent of the global population, respectively) \\nwere estimated to be undernourished in 2023. \\nConsidering the mid-range estimate (733\\xa0million), \\nabout 152 million more people may have faced \\nhunger in 2023 compared to\\xa02019. \\nAfrica is the region with the largest percentage \\nof the population facing hunger – 20.4 percent, \\ncompared with 8.1 percent in Asia, 6.2\\xa0percent \\nin Latin America and the Caribbean, and \\n7 .3 percent in Oceania. However, Asia is still \\nhome to the largest number: 384.5\\xa0million, \\nor\\xa0more than half of all those facing hunger \\nin the world.

Private actors must \\nincorporate health, environmental and social \\nrisks into their financial decision-making, to \\nshift financing flows from potentially harmful \\ninvestments to others that work towards the \\nachievement of health, environmental and \\nsocial outcomes. \\nNational governments can further mobilize \\ndomestic tax revenues, increase priority sector \\nexpenditures on food security and nutrition and \\nconsider repurposing policy support. Countries \\nthat already have a higher ability to access \\nfinancing must enact stronger controls on tax \\nhavens and money laundering, which often \\nallow tax evasion from countries with limited \\naccess to financing. \\nFinally, filling the information gap will require \\nbold steps from the international community; \\notherwise, the likelihood of achieving \\ndevelopment goals cannot be realistically \\nestimated and projected.\\nTHE WAY FORWARD \\nWhile global levels of hunger and food \\ninsecurity have essentially not changed for two \\nyears, there has been encouraging progress in \\nmany subregions of the world.

This is the potential \\nwe need to harness: the potential for positive \\nchange and the full realization of the right to \\nadequate food and a standard of living that \\nguarantees the dignity, health and well-being of \\nall people, especially future generations.\\nA serious problem is the lack of a common \\ndefinition or standard for measuring financing \\nfor food security and nutrition.

Progress \\nto address many drivers has been slow, and the \\nincreasing occurrence and intensity of several of \\nthese drivers will keep us on a worsening trajectory \\nunless the risks are firmly addressed.\\nPrevious editions of this report have repeatedly \\nhighlighted the intensification of several major drivers \\nof food insecurity and malnutrition, specifically \\nconflict, climate variability and extremes, and \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns, combined with \\nthe well-established underlying factors that contribute \\nto food insecurity and malnutrition, such as lack \\nof access to and unaffordability of nutritious foods, \\nunhealthy food environments, and high and persistent \\ninequalit y.1–4 Not only are the major drivers increasing \\nin frequency and intensity, they are occurring \\nconcurrently more often, and in combination with the \\nunderlying factors, resulting in increasing numbers \\nof hungry and food-insecure people (see Chapter\\xa03).5 \\nIn\\xa0this report, these known and intensifying factors, \\nand the complex combinations of them that are behind \\npersistently high levels of hunger, food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition, are referred to as “major drivers” , unless \\nspecified otherwise in the text.\\nDrivers external to agrifood systems (e.g. conflict, \\nclimate extremes) and internal (e.g. low productivity \\nand inadequate supply of nutritious foods, notably \\nfruits and vegetables, and excessive offer of cheap, \\nhighly processed energy-dense foods, high in \\nfats, sugars and/or salt) are driving up the cost of \\nnutritious foods, increasing the unaffordability of \\nhealthy diets.5, 6 This cost increase is challenging food \\nsecurity and nutrition not only in rural areas, but \\nalso across the rural–urban continuum, as is shown \\nin last year’s edition of this report.6 Depending on \\nthe major driver or combination of drivers affecting \\nfood security and nutrition in a country, addressing \\nthem will require a portfolio of policies across six \\ntransformative pathways, as outlined in detail in The \\nState of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021.5\\nTo attain the scale of actions needed, sufficient \\nlevels of and equal access to financing to address \\nfood security and nutrition challenges are essential. \\nAs highlighted in the 2022 edition of this report, \\nrepurposing current food and agricultural policy \\nsupport is essential to be more cost effective and \\nefficient and to align with the goal of ending hunger, \\nfood insecurity and all forms of malnutrition.7 Much of \\nthe food and agriculture support is not always aligned \\nto this goal and sometimes inadvertently undermines \\nfood security and nutrition and related health outcomes. \\nRepurposing current public budgets alone is not \\nenough to reach SDG\\xa02 Targets\\xa02.1 and\\xa02.2. Mobilizing, \\nallocating and safeguarding finance to address the \\nmain determinants of food security and nutrition and \\nthe major drivers behind recent trends is critical. \\nThe theme of this year’s report focuses on the financing \\nto achieve SDG Targets\\xa02.1 and\\xa02.2 – financing to end \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its \\nforms. After providing the latest estimates of food \\nsecurity and various nutrition indicators around the \\nworld in Chapter\\xa02, the report tries to answer urgent \\nquestions related to the current state of financing \\nto achieve food security and address all forms of \\nmalnutrition. Despite having a commonly agreed upon \\ndefinition of food security and nutrition, there are \\nstark differences in the estimates of its current levels \\nof financing. In Chapter\\xa03, the report explores the \\nreasons for these discrepancies and proposes a new \\ndefinition and methodology for measuring financing \\nfor food security and nutrition. This new definition and \\nmethodology address the main determinants and major \\ndrivers of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition \\nin all its forms. \\nApplying this new definition and methodology, \\nChapter\\xa04 provides estimates of the current levels of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition and outlines \\nthe financing gap to achieve SDG Targets\\xa02.1 and \\n2.2. Closing this sizeable financing gap will require \\ninnovative, inclusive and scalable financing options \\ntargeting the main determinants and major drivers \\nof hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its \\nforms. Chapter\\xa05 takes a deep dive into the options for \\ninnovative and synergetic scalable financing based on a \\ntypology of countries defined by their food security and \\nnutrition situation and ability to obtain financing. It also \\nlooks at how to achieve better alignment and synergies \\nbetween different sources of financing to achieve \\nSDG\\xa0Targets\\xa02.1 and\\xa02.2, including climate finances, \\nemergency funding and development finances, and the \\nchanges needed in the current financing architecture \\nto achieve the scalable and innovative financing \\nneeded to achieve food security and address all forms \\nof malnutrition. n\\n| 1 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 33, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='VIET NAM\\nFarmers working on rice \\nterraces: reducing \\nclimate-related risks. \\n© saravutpics/\\nShutterstock.com'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 34, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='CHAPTER 2 \\nFOOD SECURITY \\nAND NUTRITION \\nAROUND THE \\nWORLD\\nT\\n \\n \\nhis chapter presents an updated \\nglobal assessment of food security \\nand nutrition up to the year 2023 and \\na report on progress towards meeting SDG \\nTargets\\xa02.1 and 2.2 – ending hunger and ensuring \\naccess to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for \\nall people all year round and eradicating all \\nforms of malnutrition by 2030. \\nSection 2.1 presents an updated assessment of \\nthe state of food security and progress towards \\nachieving the hunger and food insecurity target \\n(SDG Target 2.1).

Since the last edition \\nof this report, FAO’s Statistics Division has gained \\naccess to the full microdata sets of 14 surveys \\nfrom 13\\xa0countries, which have been processed \\nto update the CV|y for the following country/year \\ncombinations: Armenia (2022), Costa\\xa0Rica (2019), \\nCôte d’Ivoire\\xa0(2022), India (2011/12 and 2022/23), \\nJordan\\xa0(2017), Kazakhstan (2022), Maldives\\xa0(2016), \\nMali (2022), Mexico (2022), Niger (2022), \\nRepublic\\xa0of Moldova (2022), Senegal (2022) and \\nTimor-Leste (2015).\\nThe newly estimated CV|y parameters replaced \\nprevious values for those countries and years, \\nwhich may have been based on interpolation or \\non modelling. This often also requires a revision of \\nthe same parameter in the same country for the \\npreceding and subsequent years, in order to reconcile \\nthe old and the new information through consistent \\ninterpolations and extrapolations (see Annex 1B).\\nIn addition to the revision of the PoU series for the \\ncountries where new survey data are available and \\nthe corresponding revisions of the underlying regional \\nand global aggregates, one very visible effect of the \\navailability of new data from nine surveys conducted \\nafter 2021 is the reduction in the uncertainty that \\nsurrounds the estimates of the PoU for 2022 and 2023. \\nThis is so, given the introduction in the analysis of direct \\nevidence on the degree of inequality in food access \\nfor those countries. In previous editions of this report, \\nthe relatively higher level of uncertainty induced by \\nthe lack of national data to reflect the effects of the \\npandemic resulted in the need to introduce upper and \\nlower bounds to the series in 2020, 2021 and 2022 \\n(see Supplementary material to Chapter 2). While the \\nuncertainty around what the real situation was in those \\nyears will never disappear, we\\xa0hope that access to more \\nfrequent information on food consumption from more \\ncountries will continue to be available in the future, to \\nmake our assessments of the state of food insecurity in \\nthe world always more reliable.\\n| 6 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 38, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\ntrend, but the recovery has been considerably \\nstronger.

To inform decision-makers \\nabout this evolving situation, the Global Report on \\nFood Crises 1 details the acute food insecurity in a set \\nof countries that are currently exposed to food crisis \\nsituations. Both The State of Food Security and Nutrition \\nin the World and the Global Report on Food Crises are \\nmultipartnership efforts that provide international \\nanalyses of food security, but\\xa0readers should be aware \\nof their different objectives and geographical scope, \\nas well as their reliance on distinctly different data and \\nmethodologies for their analyses. \\nOne important distinction is that, by reporting \\non SDG 2 indicators, The State of Food Security \\nand Nutrition in the World has the broad objective \\nof monitoring chronic food insecurity – defined as \\nfood insecurity that persists over time, largely due to \\nstructural causes – in all countries, on a regular basis. \\nThe focus of the Global Report on Food Crises, on the \\nother hand, is on acute food insecurity, which refers \\nto any manifestation of food insecurity at a specific \\npoint in time that is of a severity that threatens lives, \\nlivelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or \\nduration. Analyses of acute food insecurity reported in \\nthe Global Report on Food Crises are based mainly on \\nthe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification/Cadre \\nHarmonisé (IPC/CH), and they differ considerably from \\nthose that inform the SDG indicators. 2 Since timeliness \\nis of the essence in crisis situations, IPC/CH rapid \\nassessments are conducted by local teams of analysts \\nthrough a consultative process among the main food \\nsecurity partners in the country, including government \\ncounterparts, aimed at finding convergence among \\nall pieces of sometimes partial available evidence, \\nincluding data from official and non-official sources \\ncommonly collected and used by the international \\nhumanitarian community. \\nAccording to the Global Report on Food Crises 2024, \\nnearly 282\\xa0million people faced high levels of acute \\nfood insecurity in the 59\\xa0food-crisis countries/territories \\nthat were included in the analysis in 2023.* The five \\ncountries with the largest numbers of people facing \\nhigh levels of acute food insecurity were, in descending \\norder, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \\nNigeria, the Sudan, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, while \\nthe countries with the largest share of the analysed \\npopulation facing high levels of acute food insecurity \\nwere Palestine (Gaza\\xa0Strip), South\\xa0Sudan, Yemen, the \\nSyrian Arab Republic and Haiti. One hundred percent \\nof the population of the Gaza Strip faced high levels \\nof acute food insecurity, as did more than half of the \\npeople living in South Sudan, Yemen and the Syrian \\nArab Republic, and nearly half the population of Haiti. \\nOver 705 000 people in five countries/territories** \\nwere projected to be facing Catastrophe (IPC/CH \\nPhase\\xa05) levels of acute food insecurity in 2023, \\nmost of them (576\\xa0000) in the Gaza Strip. The Gaza \\nStrip became the most severe food crisis since IPC \\nassessments were first conducted. By late 2023, the \\nentire population of 2.2 \\xa0million was classified as facing \\nCrisis conditions or worse (IPC Phase\\xa03 or above), and \\n80 percent of the population was internally displaced. \\nAn IPC Special Brief on Gaza 3 dated 18 March 2024 \\nwarned of an imminent risk of famine, with more \\nthan a quarter of the population facing Catastrophe \\n(IPC Phase\\xa05) levels of acute food insecurity, which \\nat that time was projected to expand to threaten half \\nthe population – 1.1\\xa0million people – by July 2024 \\nif hostilities and restricted access to humanitarian \\naid continued. \\nA surge in conflict in the Sudan also contributed \\nto extraordinarily high levels of acute food insecurity, \\nwith\\xa0more than 20\\xa0million people facing Crisis \\nconditions or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) during the \\nlean season in June–September in 2023.

The different \\ntrajectories are evident, demonstrating that \\npractically all progress in the fight against \\nhunger is expected to be made in Asia, with \\na strong recovery in the second half of the \\ndecade, where the number of undernourished is \\nprojected to fall from the current 385 million to \\n229\\xa0million people by 2030, nearly halving the \\nprevalence of undernourishment (4.8 percent \\nby 2030).

In 2023, an \\nestimated 28.9\\xa0percent of the global population \\n– 2.33 billion people – were moderately or \\nseverely food insecure, meaning they did not \\nhave regular access to adequate food. While \\nthe prevalence remained virtually unchanged \\nfrom 2020 to 2023, the number of people facing \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity in the world \\nnevertheless increased by more than 65 million, \\nas the global population grew during that period \\n(Table 3 and Table 4).\\nThese estimates include 10.7 percent of the \\npopulation – or more than 864 million people – \\nwho were severely food insecure, meaning they \\nhad run out of food at times during the year and, \\nat worst, gone an entire day or more without \\neating. The prevalence of severe food insecurity \\nat the global level rose from 9.1 percent in 2019 to \\n10.6 percent in 2020 and has remained stubbornly \\nunchanged since then. \\nComparing situations in the different regions of \\nthe world in 2023, Africa remains the region with \\nthe largest proportion of the population facing \\nfood insecurity. The prevalence of moderate or \\nsevere food insecurity in Africa (58.0 percent) is \\nnearly double the global average, whereas in Asia, \\nLatin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania, \\nthe prevalence is closer to and slightly below \\nthe global estimate – 24.8, 28.2 and 26.8 percent, \\nrespectively. From 2022 to 2023, food insecurity \\nat moderate or severe levels remained virtually \\nunchanged in Africa and Asia, while it worsened \\nin Oceania and, to a lesser extent, in Northern \\nAmerica and Europe. In contrast, notable progress \\nwas made in the Latin American and Caribbean \\nregion ( Table 3, Table 4 and Figure 4).\\nIn Africa, 58.0 percent of the population was \\nmoderately or severely food insecure in 2023, \\nand\\xa021.6\\xa0percent faced severe food insecurity, \\nalthough the differences between subregions \\nwere notable.

For example, \\nfood\\xa0insecurity has been found to be associated with \\nlower consumption of all types of foods and higher share \\nof dietary energy from staple foods in some contexts, \\nwhile in others it has been found to be associated \\nwith lower consumption of nutritious foods and higher \\nconsumption of energy-dense foods high in unhealthy \\nfats, sugars and salt. 20\\nFood insecurity, therefore, may affect diets in a \\nvariety of ways that could potentially contribute to \\nseveral forms of malnutrition including undernutrition \\n(stunting, wasting and micronutrient deficiencies) but \\nalso to overweight and obesity. 11, 21  However, because \\nmost studies collect food insecurity and dietary intake \\ndata using different samples, data collection modalities \\nand analysis approaches, thus hampering comparison \\nof the results, it has been difficult to explore the \\nassociations between the severity of food insecurity and \\nthe healthiness of diets across countries. \\nFAO has been collecting food security data annually \\nusing the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) \\nsince 2014 through the Gallup © World Poll (GWP). \\nBeginning in 2021, new data on diet quality have also \\nbeen collected in the GWP in a growing number of \\ncountries using the Diet Quality Questionnaire (DQQ), \\nproviding an opportunity to explore the associations \\nbetween food insecurity and properties of a healthy \\ndiet in a comparable way across countries.

Less than \\n50 percent of severely food-insecure women achieved \\nMDD-W, while over 77 percent who were food secure or \\nmildly food insecure achieved MDD- W.

It was also associated \\nwith lower odds of consuming a diet that protects against \\nNCDs (based on the NCD-Protect indicator) as well as \\nlower odds of consuming foods linked with greater risk \\nof NCDs (based on the NCD-Risk indicator). That is, the \\nmore food insecure men and women were, the fewer \\nhealthy and unhealthy food groups they consumed. \\nIn isolation, the finding that greater food insecurity was \\nassociated with lower consumption of unhealthy food \\ngroups may give the impression that food insecurity was \\nassociated with better adherence to dietary moderation. \\nHowever, in this pooled sample of data from 28\\xa0countries, \\n21 of which were low- or lower-middle-income countries, \\ngreater severity of food insecurity suggested a general \\nlack of access to (or availability of) all food groups, \\nhealthy as well as unhealthy. \\nSome UN agencies are already routinely collecting \\nboth FIES and MDD-W data in the same surveys. \\nSince 2022, the International Fund for Agricultural \\nDevelopment (IFAD) has been collecting MDD-W \\ndata through surveys in several countries, including \\nCameroon, Cabo\\xa0Verde, Nepal and Türkiye, for project \\nreporting. In addition, FIES data are used for the \\nImpact Assessment Corporate Reporting Programme to \\nmeasure the attributable impact of IFAD’s investment \\nprojects in each replenishment period. \\nHealthy diets and the SDGs\\nEnsuring healthy diets is key to achieving SDG\\xa02 \\nand a prerequisite for achieving many other goals. \\nHowever, diets are not currently captured by any of \\nthe SDG 2 indicators that monitor the prevalence \\nof undernourishment (hunger), moderate or severe \\nfood insecurity based on FIES, and four indicators of \\nnutritional status (stunting, wasting and overweight \\namong children under five years of age, and anaemia \\namong women aged 15 to 49 years). 24 The absence \\nof an indicator of diet quality in the SDG indicator \\nframework therefore represents a gap in the \\nmonitoring of progress towards the 2030 Agenda for \\nSustainable Development. \\nTo address this issue, a group of Member States \\n(Bangladesh, Brazil, Malawi and Switzerland), with the \\nsupport of FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO have \\nrecommended that the “Prevalence of Minimum Dietary \\nDiversity” (among women and children) be included as \\nan SDG 2 indicator through the 2025 Comprehensive \\nReview.

For example, past editions of this \\nreport have presented analyses of the association \\nbetween food insecurity and different forms \\nof malnutrition 11 as well as diet. 12 There are \\nmultiple pathways whereby the experience of \\nfood insecurity may contribute to various forms \\nof malnutrition, but the main ones pass through \\ndiet. 11 For this reason, it is important to enhance \\nour understanding of how food insecurity, \\nincluding moderate levels of severity, may be \\nassociated with diets. However, the collection \\nof food consumption data in a way that allows \\nfor the comparison of diets across countries and \\ncultures is a daunting challenge, and several \\ninitiatives are currently underway to meet this \\nchallenge. One such initiative is collecting dietary \\ndata in many of the same surveys that collect \\nFIES data, providing the unique opportunity to \\nexamine the association between food insecurity \\nand diet ( Box 3). \\nThe lack of improvement in food security and \\nthe uneven progress in the economic access to \\nhealthy diets cast a shadow over the possibilities \\nof achieving Zero Hunger in the world, six years \\naway from the 2030 deadline. There is the need \\nto accelerate the transformation of our agrifood \\nsystems with greater resilience to the major \\ndrivers, addressing inequalities to ensure that \\nhealthy diets are affordable and available to all. n \\n2.2\\nCOST AND AFFORDABILITY \\nOF A HEALTHY DIET\\n KEY MESSAGES \\nè New food price data and methodological \\nimprovements have resulted in updated estimates of the \\ncost and more accurate estimates of the affordability of \\na healthy diet, leading to a revision of the entire series of \\nboth sets of indicators. \\nè Food prices rose throughout 2022, pushing \\nup the average cost of a healthy diet globally to \\n3.96\\xa0purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars per \\nperson per day, up from 3.56 PPP dollars in 2021. \\nDisruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the \\nwar in Ukraine contributed to significant increases in \\ninternational food and energy prices, exacerbating \\ninflationary pressures.\\n»\\n| 22 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 54, 'page_label': '23'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nè Despite the increase in food prices over 2022, \\nthe\\xa0number of people unable to afford a healthy diet \\nin the world fell back to pre-pandemic levels in the \\nsame year (2.83\\xa0billion people), fuelled by an economic \\nrecovery from the pandemic that has, nevertheless, \\nbeen uneven across regions and country income groups.\\nè The number of people unable to afford a healthy \\ndiet dropped below pre-pandemic levels in Asia and \\nin Northern America and Europe, while increasing \\nsubstantially in Africa, where the number rose to \\n924.8\\xa0million in 2022, up by 24.6 million from 2021, \\nand\\xa0by 73.4\\xa0million from 2019.\\nè The unequal recovery is even more evident across \\ncountry income groups.

Affordability means that \\npeople can devote enough money to food to purchase \\nlocally all the least expensive food items needed to \\nconsume a healthy diet. This excludes the possibility \\nof consuming expensive food items if a nutritionally \\nequivalent, lower-cost option is available. \\nWhen determining how much of a household’s total \\ndisposable income can be reasonably devoted to food, \\nit is important to consider the minimum amount that \\npeople must reserve to purchase the non‑food basic \\ngoods and services needed to conduct a dignified life. \\nIn past editions of this report, this amount was roughly \\napproximated by a fixed proportion (48 percent) of \\nthe household’s total disposable income. 29 The same \\npercentage was applied to all countries, justified by \\nthe observation that, on average, people in low-income \\ncountries spend 52 percent of their income on food. \\nFurthermore, it was assumed that using this average \\nproportion would not introduce a systematic bias, \\ndespite the expectation that poor people must devote \\nrelatively more of their income, and wealthier people \\nrelatively less, to basic food needs. In hindsight, the \\nassumption that the implicit misclassification errors \\nwould cancel out, in the aggregate, was incorrect. \\nThis year FAO, in collaboration with the World Bank, \\nbegan implementing a change to the methodology to \\nreflect the fact that the amount needed to purchase \\nnon-food basic goods and services varies across \\nhouseholds in ways that are not simply proportional to \\ntheir income. \\nThe ideal approach would entail determining, \\nfor\\xa0each country separately, the cost of a normatively \\ndefined bundle of such goods and services, based on \\nmarket prices (similarly to what we do to price the cost \\nof a healthy diet). Unfortunately, such an approach is \\nnot feasible as it would require deciding what is to be \\nincluded in the bundle of essential goods and services \\nand having access to detailed prices on those goods \\nand services. \\nDue to the lack of country-specific information \\nneeded to determine the cost of basic non-food goods \\nand services, this edition employs a feasible approach \\nbased on the World Bank’s country classifications by \\nincome. The approach defines non-food spending as \\nthe daily cost evaluated at the country income group’s \\ninternational poverty line and assigns non-food spending \\nshares related to each group.* The new method involves \\nmultiplying country income group-specific international \\npoverty lines by the non-food expenditure shares for \\neach country income group to calculate the daily cost of \\nbasic non-foods in a country, as illustrated in Table A.\\nFor each country a threshold is computed that \\ncombines the least-cost healthy diet of the country (i ) \\nand the income group-specific cost of non-food basic \\nneeds (j ):\\nCost Threshold i = CoHD i + (IntlPovLine j  \\n× NonfoodExpShare Income j)\\nFinally, this threshold is compared with the \\ncountry-specific income distribution sourced by the \\nWorld Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform to estimate \\nthe percentage of the population whose income is below \\nthat threshold. In this way, it is recognized that the \\ncost to achieve a minimally adequate standard of living \\n TABLE A   CALCULATION OF THE COST OF NON-FOOD BASIC GOODS AND SERVICES\\n\\xa0 International poverty line\\n(a)\\nNon-food expenditure share\\n(b)\\nCost of non-food basics\\n(a) × (b)\\n(2017 PPP dollars per person per day)\\nLow-income countries 2.15 0.37 0.80\\nLower-middle-income countries 3.65 0.44 1.61\\nUpper-middle-income countries 6.85 0.54 3.70\\nHigh-income countries 24.36 0.54 13.20\\nSOURCE: Bai, Y., Herforth, A., Cafiero, C., Conti, V., Rissanen, M.O., Masters, W.A. & Rosero Moncayo, J.

The true rate of the double burden is much \\nhigher if all forms of malnutrition are considered, including \\nmicronutrient deficiencies. \\nè Double-duty actions simultaneously tackle \\nundernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight \\nand obesity by leveraging the common drivers shared \\nby all forms of malnutrition. Such actions include \\nprovision of antenatal care, exclusive breastfeeding, \\nprovision of healthy, nutritious foods to children \\nduring the complementary feeding period and \\nbeyond, school-feeding programmes, micronutrient \\nsupplementation, social protection, nutrition-sensitive \\nagriculture, food fortification, and policies that improve \\nthe food environment.\\nNutrition is a maker and a marker of \\ndevelopment. 36 The benefits of good nutrition \\nhave widespread ripple effects, from families to \\ncommunities, regions and nations.

Malnutrition, \\nincluding micronutrient deficiencies, during the \\nvulnerable foetal, infant and early childhood \\nstages increases morbidity and mortality \\nrisk, 43, 44  delays physical growth, and weakens \\nthe immune system resulting in recurrent illness \\nand infection; it can also lead to suboptimal \\ncognitive development and permanent changes \\nin the structure and function of organ systems, \\nthus setting the stage for susceptibility to chronic \\ndiseases in adulthood. 45, 46  Studies have shown \\nthat prenatal nutrition interventions can lead \\nto improved birth outcomes, which in turn are \\nassociated with better education and human \\ncapital outcomes later in life. 47, 48 Children who \\nhave access to more nutritious foods in early \\nchildhood are more economically productive in \\nadulthood. 49 In contrast, nutritional deficiencies \\nduring early childhood impair brain development, \\nimpact learning ability and school readiness, \\nsuppressing life-long achievement potential \\nand exacerbating health disparities and social \\ninequalit y.50 Monitoring the global nutrition \\nindicators through the lens of the life course thus \\nacknowledges the uniqueness of each life stage \\nand supports national and global efforts to tackle \\nthe malnutrition landscape holistically. \\n| 32 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 64, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nGlobal and regional trends \\nThis subsection provides the latest status for the \\nseven nutrition targets at global level ( Figure 10) \\nand regionally ( Table 7). \\nVirtually no progress has been made for \\nlow birthweight among newborns, with a \\nprevalence of 15\\xa0percent (21.6 million) in 2012 \\nand 14.7 percent (19.8 million) in 2020 – the latest \\nyear with available data.

This is often associated with globalization, \\nrapid urbanization, and sedentary lifestyles, \\ncontributing to the “epidemiological transition” – \\na shift in malnutrition burden in the population \\nfrom a predominance of undernutrition to \\noverweight and obesity, and in disease burden \\nfrom infectious diseases to NCDs. The prevalence \\nof micronutrient deficiencies continues to prevail \\nacross all global regions, despite evidence of the \\nnutrition transition, and is often omitted from \\nestimates of the double burden. 43, 57  Micronutrient \\ndeficiencies may continue to prevail across the \\ntransition. Furthermore, the population structure \\nis modified largely due to lower birth rates and \\nincreased life expectancy. This “demographic \\ntransition” is characterized by a shift in average \\npopulation age from younger to older and is \\naccompanied by concomitantly higher NCD \\nrisks. 58 While in the past these transitions \\noccurred gradually over centuries, they have \\naccelerated in recent decades, with dietary \\nchanges and nutritional heterogeneity as well as \\ndisease risk rising significantly in just a single \\ngeneration. Policymakers thus face unprecedented \\nchallenges in addressing both overweight and \\nundernutrition and their associated health and \\neconomic implications.\\nThe NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) 59 \\nrecently conducted a study on the double \\nburden of malnutrition from 1990 to 2022 among \\nadults, school-age children, and adolescents in \\n200\\xa0countries and territories. In this analysis, \\nthe double burden was calculated as the sum of \\nthe prevalence of underweight or thinness and \\nobesity. The true rate of double burden is much \\nhigher if all forms of malnutrition are considered, \\nincluding micronutrient deficiencies. 57 Results \\nreveal that in most regions, decreases in the \\ndouble burden were due to declining underweight \\nand thinness, while increases in the double \\nburden were driven by increases in overweight \\nand obesity. A transition occurred in most \\ncountries from a predominance of underweight \\nand thinness towards a predominance in \\noverweight and obesity, with some exceptions \\nsuch as in Southern Asia, where a decline in \\nunderweight was not offset by an increase in \\nobesity. While population levels of obesity were \\nhighest among adults in 1990, school-age children \\nand adolescents are increasingly affected by \\nobesity in the twenty-first century. 60\\nFigure 13  illustrates the global double burden \\nphenomenon among school-age children \\n(5–9\\xa0years), adolescents (10–19 years), adults \\n(20–59\\xa0years) and the elderly (60+ years)  from 2000 \\nto the latest available data (2022) and projected \\nto 2030.

However, \\nthere is no coherent picture of the total amount of \\nfinancial resources being spent on food security \\nand nutrition, nor of the cost of achieving SDG \\nTargets 2.1 and 2.2, in part due to the absence of \\nan agreed upon definition of financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nAlthough there is clarity and agreement on \\nthe definition and concept of food security \\nand nutrition, and agreed SDG indicators to \\nmeasure the levels and severity of hunger, food \\ninsecurity and all forms of malnutrition around \\nthe world, there is no equally accepted definition \\nof financing for food security and nutrition. \\nThis is the main issue explored and addressed \\nin this chapter. \\nWithout a standardized definition, it will not be \\npossible to assess adequately the existing levels \\nand gaps in financing for food security and \\nnutrition, nor to monitor progress or setbacks \\nin financing efforts to achieve the goal of \\nending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of \\nmalnutrition.

Disentangling \\nwhat constitutes financing for food security and \\nnutrition remains a non -trivial and challenging \\nexercise. This predicament poses a multitude \\nof challenges, not only in tracking the current \\nlevels of financing flows to food security and \\nnutrition, but also in identifying underfinanced \\nareas, ensuring accountability of institutions, \\nand\\xa0tracking the impact of interventions \\nfinanced. Moving towards a common definition \\nand mapping of financing for food security and \\nnutrition is not straightforward, and there are \\nthree main challenges: \\n1. Food security and nutrition are complex \\nmultidimensional concepts that do not neatly \\nfit into a sector-defined financing framework. \\n2. Different initiatives measure financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition differently, although \\noften adopting similar language. \\n3.

Interventions to \\nachieve food security and nutrition span various \\nsectors and dimensions of economic, health, \\nsocial and environmental development, among \\nothers. However, financing flows and budgets \\nare normally defined and classified by sector \\nand, within each sector, by purpose. In\\xa0shifting \\nfrom a sector -based classification system to an \\noutcome-based measure, complex issues arise \\nregarding the contribution of sector-based \\nresources to the main determinants of food \\nsecurity and nutrition.\\nClassification systems are necessary in \\nfinancial databases both to avoid the double \\ncounting of resources and to enable temporal \\nstatistical analysis across funders. 5–7 In\\xa0the \\nmain ODA database – Organisation for \\nEconomic Co-operation and Development \\n(OECD) Development Assistance Committee \\n(DAC) – the purpose of aid is recorded using \\na classification system comprising two layers: \\nsector codes subdivided into purpose codes. \\nFor\\xa0example, the\\xa0sector code relating to \\nagriculture, encompassing agriculture, forestry \\nand fishing, is 310.

The sector and purpose \\ncodes are selected by the donor when they input \\nODA data into the database. 7 For the full list of \\nOECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) \\npurpose codes, see Table\\xa0S3.1 in the Supplementary \\nmateria l to Chapter\\xa03 . \\nDatabases related to domestic public finance and \\nprivate finance also have classification systems \\nthat are roughly consistent with international \\ni Agriculture here includes both crops and livestock. \\n| 48 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 80, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nstandards. For public budgets, these classification \\nsystems follow a common framework whereby \\nexpenditures are structured by administrative, \\neconomic, functional and geographical \\nnomenclatures that explain how public resources \\nare being spent: by whom, on what and where. \\nEach of these nomenclatures carries information \\nthat would form the basis for a complete and \\naccurate classification of data, be it a sector-based, \\nfunction-based or outcome-based classification \\nsystem. However, budgetary information that is \\npublicly available is most often not disaggregated \\nto the kind of granular level that would allow for \\na proper classification of domestic public finance, \\nand this caveat is especially true for function- \\nand outcome-based classification systems. \\nFor\\xa0the private sector, a common framework is \\neven more complicated in the absence of central \\nrecord-keeping and a commonly agreed upon \\nreporting framework. Data, where available, tend \\nto be defined at a sectoral level. For example, \\nforeign direct investment (FDI) data are available \\nas flows to agriculture, forestry and fishing or \\nto food, beverages and tobacco. Alternatively, \\ndata on credit to agriculture are available as an \\naggregate of agriculture, forestry and fishing, \\nor\\xa0for each subsector individually. j \\nWhile standard classification systems are \\nnecessary for financial records, several issues arise \\nwhen building from sector-based classification \\nsystems to an outcome-based classification. \\nThis outcome -based classification is crucial to \\ndefine and measure the level and composition of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition. \\nNotwithstanding that sector-based classifications \\nare used extensively to assess governments’ \\nefforts in support of agriculture, they show \\nlimitations when it comes to assessing financing \\ncontributions to food security and nutrition \\noutcomes. For example, an energy project in a \\nrural area may improve agricultural productivity \\nthrough access to electricity for irrigation and \\nmechanized equipment, as well as facilities to \\nstore and clean food, thereby having a strong, \\npositive impact on food security and nutrition. \\nThis may be recorded as a financial contribution \\nj For more information about data availability, classification and \\nlimitations for different financing streams, see the FAO and Shamba \\nCentre for Food & Climate background note. 7\\nto the energy sector, since financing is most \\noften recorded based on what a given project \\nis designed to achieve and the sector relevant \\nto the intervention, and not on the outcomes \\nof the project. This distinction between sector \\nand outcome complicates the definition of \\nthe financing for food security and nutrition, \\nas it requires making assumptions about the \\ncontribution of sector-allocated finance to food \\nsecurity and nutrition outcomes. 7 \\nRecently, new policy markers and tags have been \\nadded in some financial databases to capture the \\ncross -sectoral and/or multipurpose nature of \\ndevelopment policy objectives. However, there \\nis still a lack of consistency and differences in \\ndefinitions applied to formulate these objectives. \\nFor example, the OECD DAC has added an SDG \\npolicy marker to indicate which ODA grants are \\nrelevant to which SDGs, and policy markers exist \\nfor climate adaptation and mitigation, nutrition \\nand gender, among others. However, the use of \\ntags and markers is not fully consistent, and the \\nprocess through which markers are developed \\neither supports or inhibits stronger synergies \\nacross sectors. To date, while an OECD DAC \\nmethodology for a nutrition marker has been \\ndeveloped, it has not been applied consistently. \\nFurthermore, in light of the complex, \\ncross-sectoral nature of achieving food \\nsecurity and ending all forms of malnutrition, \\ndevelopment programmes are increasingly \\nshifting away from strategies and portfolios \\nthat achieve single outcomes towards projects \\nwith multiple outcomes. This creates yet more \\ntension with the coding systems common in \\nfinancial databases. For instance, within the \\nOECD DAC, there are three main ways to record \\na multisectoral project. First, it can be classified \\nas a multisectoral project (i.e. purpose code \\n43010).8 Second, a documentation review can \\nbe undertaken to disaggregate the project into \\nseparate components, each recorded under \\ndifferent codes corresponding to the focus of that \\nportion of the budget. Third, all the resources \\ncan be recorded based on the project’s principal \\ncomponent and the primary sector to which it \\nis intended to contribute.

Due to the variety \\nof approaches for recording cross-sectoral \\nprojects, financing for food security and nutrition \\nmay be recorded inaccurately or differently, \\ndepending on the donor. \\nSimilar challenges on linking sector-based coding \\nsystems to outcome-based classifications apply to \\ndomestic public budgets as well. Disaggregated \\ndata at the activity level and detailed project \\ndocumentation, which are not always readily \\navailable, are needed to classify public finance \\nby its contributions towards food security and \\nnutrition dimensions. Within databases for \\nprivate resources, there is less data availability \\nand data disaggregation, and therefore less clarity \\non how multisectoral projects are coded. \\nDefining financing for food security and \\nnutrition will require the identification of, \\nand agreement on, the interventions and \\nsectors that impact food security and nutrition, \\nwith an awareness of the complexities and \\ninconsistencies in how projects relevant to \\nfood security and nutrition may be recorded. \\nFurthermore, attention will have to be paid \\nto the relative impact of a given investment. \\nNot all the financial resources allocated to a \\ngiven intervention or sector will have the same \\nlevel of impact on food security and nutrition \\noutcomes. The impact of some investments will \\nbe direct, like investments in more productive, \\ndiverse smallholder agriculture, while the \\nimpact of other investments, like investments in \\nbetter rural infrastructure and electrification, \\nmay be indirect and depend a great deal on \\nexisting coverage. Similarly, not all investments \\nin electrification will impact food security \\nand nutrition outcomes. Therefore, not all the \\nresources spent on electrification should be \\nincluded in a definition of financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nThe complexities between food security and \\nnutrition, as a multidimensional outcome, and \\nbinary finance coding systems significantly \\ncomplicate efforts to estimate financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. Methodologies cannot \\nrely on or be bound by the binary coding systems \\nadopted by financing databases. \\nDifferent initiatives measure financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition differently, although often \\nadopting similar language \\nEach national government uses different \\napproaches to allocate domestic public resources \\nand different approaches to define the resources \\nallocated to allegedly influence a particular \\noutcome. Where publicly available, national \\nbudgets can reveal the sectors and ministries \\nto which budgets are being allocated. However, \\nthere is no common accounting framework \\nacross governments, nor is there a common \\nmeasurement of spending on food security \\nand nutrition. Therefore, assessments of the \\nresources allocated to financing for food security \\nand nutrition may differ significantly between \\ncountries, depending on what they consider \\nto be the resources relevant, either directly or \\nindirectly, for influencing food security and \\npositive nutrition outcomes. The lack of common \\naccounting frameworks means that there have \\nbeen no formal attempts to define an agreed \\nupon measurement of financing for food security \\nand nutrition for public and private financing, \\nor that such financing has been unsuccessful or \\nnot scalable enough, whether from domestic or \\nforeign sources. \\nIn ODA, where perhaps there have been the \\ngreatest efforts to define financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition, different groups use \\ndifferent measures to define relevant ODA, \\nalthough often referring to them using similar \\nlanguage. For example, in Figure 14, observed \\ndifferences in ODA levels are generally due \\nto: i)\\xa0differences in the questions being asked; \\nand/or ii)\\xa0differences in what counts as financing \\nto support food security and nutrition. In the \\nOECD DAC, ODA records are coded according to \\ndonor, recipient, purpose of aid, and flow type \\n(commitment or disbursement), as well as other \\nvariables. 7 The codes provide a standardized way \\nof categorizing aid according to the specific sector \\nor area of development that the ODA resources \\nare intended to assist. While the ODA binary \\nnomenclature establishes a common methodology \\nto track the purpose of aid, currently, there are \\nover ten operational definitions used to calculate \\nthe volume of ODA relevant to agriculture, \\nfood security and nutrition, each of which \\ntracks ODA recorded under a different selection \\nof purpose codes. \\n| 50 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 82, 'page_label': '51'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nTo illustrate the issue, it is useful to look at the \\nunderlying reasons for the differences in the \\nvarious estimates shown in Figure 14.

All development funders – public and \\nprivate, domestic and foreign – have certain \\npriorities and targets that they want to meet. \\nFor example, in 2009, following the food price \\ncrisis, the G7 pledged to spend USD 20 billion \\non food security between 2009 and 2012. 12 \\nSince\\xa0it is normally the funder who decides how \\nresources are recorded and under which sector \\nthe budgetary allocation will be made, funders \\nmay assign different codes for similar projects \\nin order to maximize alignment with their \\npriorities and targets. \\nWhere public domestic resources are concerned, \\nstakeholders have identified a broad and \\nongoing cultural shift towards the use of aid by \\nsenior executives for political considerations. \\nIncreasingly, the biggest driver of foreign aid \\ninvestments is policy codes, especially those that \\nalign with multilateral agreements on climate and \\nbiodiversity.

Healthy diets and health \\nstatus are main determinants of nutritional status, \\nbut multiple factors related to food security \\n(e.g. availability and affordability of nutritious \\nfoods), practices (e.g. related to food and feeding, \\ncare, and health seeking) and services (e.g. clean \\nwater, health, education and social protection) all \\ninfluence the ability and mechanisms through \\nwhich individuals can achieve healthy diets and \\nadequate health. A comprehensive framework of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition therefore \\ninvolves moving beyond simplistic considerations \\nof food availability and access and delving into \\nthe broader understanding of nutrition. \\nHowever, to date there have been limited \\nefforts to include this range of interventions in \\ncomprehensive measures of financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. For example, considering \\nthe analyses presented in Figure 14, an analysis \\nof the definitions of ODA for food security and \\nnutrition highlights significant gaps in addressing \\nthe full scope of nutrition interventions. \\nOnly\\xa0two\\xa0of the definitions presented therein \\ninclude ODA targeted for water and sanitation, \\ndespite the well-established evidence of the impact \\nof safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene \\n(WASH) on nutrition outcomes. Furthermore, only \\nthe European Commission definition includes \\nfinancing for basic health care, despite this being a \\nmain determinant of nutritional status (see Table\\xa0S3.1 \\nin\\xa0the Supplementary material to Chapter\\xa03 for the \\ncomparative analysis and data sources). \\nAs seen above, currently most definitions of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition do \\nnot consider the broader set of interventions to \\naddress the main determinants of food security \\nand nutrition. Importantly, the current definitions \\nof financing do not include the financing of \\ninterventions more specifically designed to \\naddress the major drivers behind the trends in \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition which \\nhave been identified in recent editions of this \\nreport: conflict, climate variability and extremes, \\nand economic slowdowns and downturns, \\ncombined with structural underlying factors: \\nlack of access to and unaffordability of nutritious \\nfoods and unhealthy food environments, and high \\nand persistent inequality.\\nNo doubt, to get on track to meet SDG Targets\\xa02.1 \\nand 2.2, better use of existing financing and \\nnewly added financing will both be needed. \\nAt\\xa0the same time, it is difficult to understand how \\nmuch financing is available and the financing \\ngap for achieving food security and addressing \\nall forms of malnutrition in the absence of a \\ncommonly agreed upon and robust definition \\nof financing for food security and nutrition. \\nThis\\xa0definition must be theoretically underpinned \\nby the conceptual understanding and definition \\nof food security and nutrition, and their \\ndeterminants, as well as the major drivers behind \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. n\\n3.2\\nA NEW DEFINITION OF \\nFINANCING FOR FOOD \\nSECURITY AND NUTRITION \\nThis report is the first to propose a definition \\nof financing for food security and nutrition. \\nThis definition is grounded in a conceptual \\nunderstanding of the definition and determinants \\nof food security and nutrition, the interconnected \\nnature of food security and nutrition, and the \\nmajor drivers behind recent setbacks in achieving \\nan end to hunger, food insecurity and all forms \\nof malnutrition. \\nThe different financing flows to food \\nsecurity and nutrition\\nFinancing is the process of providing funds \\nfor the public and private sector to engage in \\neconomic activities, make purchases or carry \\nout investments.

The core definition \\nincludes the financing flows that support efforts \\naddressing the main determinants of food \\nsecurity and nutrition. The extended definition \\nbuilds on this, to include financing flows that \\ncontribute to addressing the major drivers and \\nunderlying structural factors behind recent \\nincreases in food insecurity and malnutrition. \\nThese definitions are articulated into one in \\nBox 7, conceptually summarized in Figure 15  and \\nexplained in detail in the sections below. \\nA core definition – the lens on food \\nsecurity and nutrition dimensions and \\ndeterminants\\nAccording to this report, food security is defined \\nas “a situation that exists when all people, at\\xa0all \\ntimes, have physical, social and economic access \\nto sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets \\ntheir dietary needs and food preferences for an \\nactive and healthy life” (see Annex 2 Glossary ). \\nBased on this definition, four food security \\ndimensions can be identified: food availability, \\neconomic and physical access to food, food \\nutilization, and stability over time ( Figure 15  and \\nFigure 16). Note that the concept of food security is \\nevolving to recognize the centrality of agency and \\nsustainability. However, these two dimensions \\nare captured under the extended definition of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition. \\nDefining the dimensions, food availability  \\naddresses whether or not safe and nutritious \\nfood is actually or potentially physically \\npresent, including aspects of production, food \\nreserves, markets and transportation, and wild \\nfoods, while\\xa0food access relates to whether or \\nnot households and individuals have sufficient \\nphysical and economic access to that food (see \\nAnnex 2 Glossary). In other words, food security \\nrequires that sufficient safe and nutritious food \\nis available to all populations, through either \\nproduction or imports, and that all people can \\nphysically and economically access adequate \\nquantities of safe and nutritious food. 22 As such, \\npoverty, and power imbalances in global food \\nsupply chains, both of which affect access and \\npurchasing power, are drivers of food insecurity \\nand malnutrition (see\\xa0the extended definition). \\nThe simple fact of having the availability of \\nand access to adequate safe and nutritious food \\nis insufficient if an individual’s physiological \\ncondition prevents them from absorbing and \\nutilizing the micronutrients in the food they \\nare consuming. 23 Thus, food security is also \\ndetermined by  food utilization, or an individual’s \\nability to utilize the calories and nutrients in the \\nfood they consume. 22 \\nAnother important aspect of food utilization \\nrefers to whether households are optimizing \\nthe consumption of safe and nutritious foods \\nto meet the dietary needs of each individual \\nwithin the household. Nutritional status , \\nhowever, depends not only on consumption \\nof adequate safe and nutritious food, but also \\non health status. Both food consumption and \\nhealth status are influenced by a variety of \\npractices including good food handling and \\npreparation, practices for children, girls and \\nwomen, intra-household distribution of food, \\nand service utilization.

Such financial resources may be \\nprovided by one or a combination of four sources of \\nfinancing: i)\\xa0public domestic, ii)\\xa0public foreign, iii)\\xa0private \\ndomestic, and iv)\\xa0private foreign. Each of the different \\nsources of financing deploys a range of financial \\ninstruments to finance short-term and long-term \\ninterventions on a commercial or concessionary basis \\n(e.g. grants or loans below markets rates).\\nFinancing for food security and nutrition therefore \\nincludes the financial resources that contribute to the \\neradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition \\nin all its forms across a rural–urban continuum. 21 \\nThe\\xa0resources are targeted to ensure the availability, \\naccess, utilization and stability of nutritious and safe \\nfood, practices that favour healthy diets, as well as \\nhealth, education and social protection services \\nthat enable adequate nutritional status across the \\nlife course.\\nAdditionally, it covers expenditures and investments \\nthat aim to ensure that all individuals are protected \\nagainst short-term or long-term instability in food \\nsecurity and nutrition, caused by various climatic, \\neconomic, social, commercial and political factors. \\nFinancing therefore encompasses all the interventions \\naligned with the six transformative policy pathways \\ndesigned to strengthen the resilience of agrifood \\nsystems to the major drivers behind hunger, food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition – namely conflicts, climate \\nvariability and extremes, and economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns – and address the underlying structural \\nfactors: lack of access to and unaffordability of \\nnutritious foods and unhealthy food environments, \\nand\\xa0high and persistent inequality.

Temporary and seasonal \\nchanges, as well as shocks and crises such as \\npolitical instability or extreme climate events, \\nare all drivers of food insecurity through their \\neffects on the availability and accessibility of \\nfood. 22 Ultimately, anything that influences any \\nof these components will influence food security. \\nEliminating hunger and food insecurity, with \\nits explicit focus on safe and nutritious food, is \\na prerequisite of good nutrition. 24 Food security \\ncan enable a healthy diet, characterized by \\nadequacy without excess of all nutrients, balance \\nin energy and sources of energy, a wide diversity \\nof foods, and moderation in the consumption \\nof foods and food components associated with \\nadverse health outcomes (see Box 3 in Section\\xa02.1 ). \\nHowever, a\\xa0healthy diet alone is insufficient \\nto ensure good nutrition, which also requires \\nadequate food, care, hygiene and health-seeking \\npractices, and access to services including \\nhealth, water, sanitation and education. \\nFinally, a crucial element within the core \\ndefinition is the recognition that food insecurity \\nand malnutrition are phenomena that are found \\nnot only in rural areas, but across a rural–urban \\ncontinuum . As Section 2.1  of this report shows, \\nwhile food insecurity is generally highest in \\nrural areas, it is also very high in peri-urban and \\nurban areas.

Access to healthy diets can be determined \\nby many factors, but this edition of the report \\nhighlights the role played by the unaffordability \\nof healthy diets ( Section 2.2 ) and unhealthy food \\nenvironments. The concept of food environment \\nrefers to the physical, economic, sociocultural, \\npolicy and legislation conditions that shape the \\naccess to and availability, affordability and safety \\nof food, as well as food preferences. Transforming \\nfood environments that can enable access to healthy \\ndiets means providing physical access to diverse, \\nsafe and nutritious foods that reduce the risk of all \\nforms of malnutrition, including undernutrition, \\noverweight and obesity, and reduce the risk of \\ndiet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). \\nBy implementing a broad-based strategy across \\ndifferent sectors, governments can create supportive \\nenvironments for healthy diets in hospitals, \\nschools, workplaces and other public institutions, \\nand address the high burden of the hidden costs \\nassociated with unhealthy diets highlighted in the \\n2020 edition of this report. 25–29  Access to nutritious \\nfoods is not only a matter of cost and affordability. \\nMany elements of the food environment influence \\ndietary patterns, while culture, language, \\nculinary practices, knowledge and consumption \\npatterns, food preferences, beliefs and values \\nall relate to the way food is sourced, generated, \\nproduced and consumed. 30\\nThe extended definition also integrates the final \\ntwo evolving dimensions of food security: agency \\nand sustainability. While these dimensions are \\nnot formally established or defined, they are \\nunderstood as the following: Agency “refers to \\nthe capacity of individuals or groups to make \\ntheir own decisions about what foods they \\neat, what foods they produce, how that food is \\nproduced, processed and distributed within \\nagrifood systems; and to their ability to engage \\nin processes that shape food system policies \\nand governance”; and, sustainability “refers \\nto the long-term ability of agrifood systems to \\nprovide food security and nutrition in a way \\nthat does not compromise the economic, social \\nand environmental bases that generate food \\nsecurity and nutrition for future generations” \\n(see\\xa0 Annex 2 Glossary).\\nUpdate of countries affected by the major drivers\\nTo generate a framework for increased financing \\nand improved finance targeting, it is imperative \\nto gain an understanding of the major drivers \\nof food insecurity and malnutrition, and of \\nthe countries affected by these major drivers. \\nIn\\xa0the last ten years, the frequency and intensity \\nof conflict, climate extremes and economic \\ndownturns have increased and are undermining \\nfood security and nutrition around the world. \\nFurthermore, high levels of income inequality \\nexacerbate the effects of these major drivers \\n(Figure 17). Of\\xa0particular concern are low - and \\nmiddle-income countries because the negative \\nimpacts on food security and nutrition are \\ngreatest in these countries and they carry the \\nbiggest burden of the world’s population who are \\nundernourished, and\\xa0children who are stunted. \\nFurther, these countries experience multiple \\nforms of malnutrition, including child overweight \\nand adult obesity (see Chapter 2 ).\\nThe analysis of the countries affected by the major \\ndrivers is a key input to generating a framework \\nfor innovative financing to scale up support to \\nfood security and nutrition, which is presented \\nin Section\\xa05.1. Therefore, the analysis of countries \\naffected by the major drivers is updated for this \\nyear’s report. Results are summarized here, while \\nthe methodology, data sources and full updated \\nanalysis are provided in the Supplementary \\nmateria l to Chapter 3 . \\nThe extent to which a major driver negatively \\naffects people’s food security and nutrition \\ndepends on their degree of exposure and their \\nvulnerability to its impact.

In \\nsummary, two\\xa0criteria are used for a country \\nto be categorized as being affected by a driver: \\ni)\\xa0evidence of the occurrence of an event related \\nto the driver in a country, for example, the \\noccurrence of a conflict, a climate extreme, or \\nan economic downturn; and ii)\\xa0evidence of \\nvulnerability to the impacts of such an event, \\nwhich refers to conditions that increase the \\nprobability that the occurrence of the driver event \\nwill negatively affect the country’s food security \\nand nutrition situation (see\\xa0Supplementary \\nmaterial to Chapter 3 , Table S3.5 for methodologies \\nand data sources). \\nWhile each of these major drivers is unique, they \\noften interact to create multiple compounding \\nimpacts transmitted through agrifood systems \\nto the detriment of food security and nutrition. 30 \\nAs a result, all dimensions of food security \\nare likely to be affected, including food \\navailability, access, utilization and stability, \\nas well as the other determinants of nutrition, \\nspecifically practices (e.g. food preparation and \\nhandling, infant and young feeding practices, \\nhealth-seeking behaviour, intra-household \\nresource allocation, and care for girls and \\nwomen) and health services and environmental \\nhealth (e.g. immunization, water and sanitation, \\nand availability and affordability of, and access \\nto health services). For instance, a growing body \\nof literature is also demonstrating the direct \\nimpact of climate, particularly extreme heat, on \\nthe nutritional status. This is corroborated by \\nthe association found between the occurrence \\nof these drivers and the food security and \\nnutrition indicators. 30 \\nAlarmingly, the majority of low- and \\nmiddle-income countries are affected by at least \\none of the major drivers and, where there are \\nmultiple drivers occurring, the compounding \\nimpacts lead to the highest increases in hunger \\nand food insecurity ( Figure 18). Countries in a \\nprotracted major food crisis are severely affected \\nby multiple drivers and face among the highest \\nlevel of food insecurity ( Box\\xa08, Figure\\xa0A1).\\nThe extended definition of financing for \\nfood security and nutrition encapsulates the \\ninterventions that contribute to one or more \\nof the six transformative policy pathways \\nproposed in the 2021 edition of this report 30 \\nto\\xa0address the major drivers of the current levels \\nof food insecurity and malnutrition. Each of \\nthe six transformative pathways leads to the \\nimplementation of policies, investments and \\nlegislation to build resilience to each one of \\nthese major drivers ( Figure 19  and Box 9). In\\xa0this \\nway, the\\xa0extended definition builds on the core \\ndefinition but goes beyond the eradication \\nof hunger, food insecurity and all forms of \\nmalnutrition to also address the major drivers.\\nMapping and application of the core and \\nextended definitions to financing\\xa0flows\\nThe application of the core and extended \\ndefinitions of financing for food security \\nand nutrition is shown in Figure 20 . Financing \\nfor building resilience to the major drivers \\nof recent increases in food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition (extended definition) is additional \\nand complementary to the core definition. \\nMoreover, as the figure shows, the extended \\ndefinition must consider country context. \\nNot all countries are affected by all the major \\ndrivers. While some are affected by a single \\ndriver, countries in which food insecurity \\nhas increased the most are usually affected \\nby a combination of drivers. This means that, \\ntheoretically, countries would not need to \\nfund the adoption of all six transformative \\npathways, but only those that address the \\nmajor drivers they are facing, considering the \\ncountry’s context. \\nTo move from the definition of financing for \\nfood security and nutrition to an application \\nof this definition to measure the levels of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition \\nrequires an understanding of how financing \\nflows are categorized and reported, and then \\nthe development of guidelines for mapping \\nthese flows to the definition. The conceptual \\nframework around food security and nutrition \\nclearly outlines the different determinants and \\npathways relevant to meeting SDG Targets 2.1 \\nand 2.2. However, assessing the degree to which \\nthe conceptual framework of food security \\nand nutrition can be mapped to financing \\nframeworks and existing databases requires a \\nmore granular disaggregation.\\n»\\n»\\n| 62 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 94, 'page_label': '63'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\n FIGURE 18   HUNGER IS HIGHER AND HAS INCREASED THE MOST IN COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY THE MAJOR \\nDRIVERS, AND HUNGER INCREASES ARE HIGHER IN POOR COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY MORE THAN ONE \\nMAJOR DRIVER\\nPREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT (%)\\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\\nAﬀected by economic downturnsAﬀected by conﬂict High income inequalityAﬀected by climate extremes\\nNot aﬀected by a major driver\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\n14\\n16\\n18\\n20\\n−1\\n1\\n0\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nDIFFERENCE IN PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT\\nFROM 2019 TO 2023 (PERCENTAGE POINTS) \\nNo driver Single driver Multiple drivers No driver Single driver Multiple drivers No driver Single driver Multiple drivers\\nLOW-INCOME COUNTRIES LOWER-MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES UPPER-MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES\\n2 9\\n12\\n11\\n23\\n17\\n18\\n17\\n10\\nNOTES: Figure 18A  shows the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) between the years 2013 and 2023 for low- and middle-income countries affected by any \\nof the three major drivers (conflict, climate extremes and economic downturns), and for countries with high income inequality.

These 19\\xa0countries have been in a \\nmajor food crisis for the past eight years, and six \\ncountries (Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the \\nCongo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Syrian Arab Republic and \\nYemen) have consistently ranked among the top ten \\nin terms of the population affected, with 108 million \\npeople facing high acute food insecurity (IPC level \\nphase 3 or above) in 2023. 31 \\nBased on this report’s analysis,** 18 of the \\n19\\xa0major protracted food crisis countries have data \\non the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU),*** \\nand\\xa0all have been affected by at least one major driver \\nof food insecurity, such as conflict, climate extremes \\nor economic downturns, between 2013 and 2022. \\nThe only exception is Eswatini, which nevertheless \\nfaces high income inequality. Thirteen countries are \\naffected by multiple drivers, a factor that mirrors the \\nextremely high level of PoU observed in 2023 in these \\ncountries (Figure\\xa0A1).\\nOver the past decade, protracted major food crisis \\ncountries have witnessed a steady rise in the PoU, \\nwith those affected by climate extremes or economic \\ndownturns facing always higher PoU levels (Figure\\xa0A2). \\nThe increase in PoU between 2019 and 2023 was \\nnotably sharper in countries affected by economic \\ndownturns (Figure\\xa0A2 and Supplementary material to \\nChapter 3, Figure\\xa0S3.6), and it was three times higher in \\nthese protracted major food crisis countries compared \\nto the rest of low- and middle-income countries \\n(2.9 percent versus 1.1 percent). \\nThe impact of major drivers on chronic hunger, \\nas measured by the PoU, in protracted major food \\ncrisis countries cannot be understated. The gap in \\nPoU between countries affected by conflict, economic \\ndownturns or climate extremes and those unaffected \\nhas widened over time (Figure A2). The compounding \\neffect of multiple drivers results in higher levels of food \\ninsecurity. Countries affected by multiple drivers saw \\nthe most significant increase in PoU between 2019 \\nand 2023, and countries affected by all three major \\ndrivers face the highest overall level of food insecurity \\n(Supplementary material to Chapter 3, Figure\\xa0S3.5 and \\nFigure\\xa0S3.6). \\nAmong the 36 countries in protracted food \\ncrisis,**** 33 countries had available PoU data. \\nThe findings described above hold true also for them. \\nAmong protracted food crisis countries, what sets \\napart countries in a protracted major food crisis is \\ntheir exposure to multiple drivers: 72\\xa0percent of \\ncountries (13\\xa0out of 18) in a protracted major food \\ncrisis are affected by multiple drivers compared with \\nonly 27 percent (4\\xa0out of 15) in a protracted food \\ncrisis. The tangible consequence is a general lower \\nlevel of PoU for the protracted food crisis countries. \\nNevertheless, it is countries in protracted food crisis, \\nexcluding major crisis, affected by conflict that \\nexperienced the highest increase in PoU between \\n2019 and 2023 (Supplementary material to Chapter\\xa03, \\nFigure\\xa0S3.7A and Figure\\xa0S3.7B). \\nThis analysis draws urgency to the call to integrate \\nhumanitarian and development approaches and \\nfinancing in protracted food crisis countries to \\naddress immediate emergency acute food insecurity \\nneeds, while also addressing chronic food insecurity, \\nincluding building resilience in agrifood systems to \\nthe major drivers and underlying structural factors. \\nFor instance, the 2023 Financing Flows and Food \\nCrises Report shows that financing related to the \\nfood sector is predominantly humanitarian, while \\ndevelopment finance represents only a small share of \\nthe financing flows related to the food sector received \\nby protracted food crisis countries. 32 \\nNOTES: * A country/territory is defined as a protracted food crisis country when it is included in all editions of the Global Report on Food Crises .

The provision of community-based animal \\nhealth services and livestock vaccinations to \\nthe Dinka Ngok and Misseriya communities in \\nthe contested Abyei area in South Sudan  and \\nthe\\xa0Sudan, working with local government bodies, \\nUnited Nations peacekeepers and other United \\nNations entities, was an effective entry point for \\nre-establishing intercommunity dialogue, leading to \\na local-level peace agreement. \\nPATHWAY 2: SCALING UP CLIMATE RESILIENCE \\nACROSS AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS\\n \\x84 Reducing climate-related risks; adapting to climate \\nchange; adopting climate risk monitoring and early \\nwarning systems; supporting climate risk insurance; \\npromoting improved access to and management \\nof natural productive assets (e.g. landscape \\nrestoration, water management); implementing \\nclimate-smart interventions.\\n \\x84 For example, in Zambia,  new initiatives aimed at \\nraising climate resilience include the introduction \\nof agricultural insurance for vulnerable households. \\nHouseholds that adopt conservation agriculture \\ntechniques are provided with access to agricultural \\ninsurance, which in turn allows them to invest in \\nriskier projects with potentially higher revenues. \\nUnder this approach, agricultural insurance is \\nimportant not only for building climate resilience but \\nalso for supporting poverty reduction and increased \\nfood security and reduced malnutrition. 30\\nPATHWAY 3: STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC RESILIENCE \\nOF THE MOST VULNERABLE TO ECONOMIC ADVERSITY\\n \\x84 Strengthening agrifood productivity and \\nmarket linkages along the food supply chain; \\ncurbing rises in food prices and excessive \\nprice volatility; boosting decent job creation; \\nexpanding social protection schemes and school \\nfeeding programmes. \\n \\x84 For example, investments to develop local \\nagro-industrial value chains can open market \\nopportunities for small-scale farmers, reducing \\ntheir vulnerability to commodity price shocks, \\nespecially in export commodity-dependent \\ncountries, and increasing their resilience based \\non diversified economic activities. In Senegal , \\nfollowing a decline in global ground prices, \\ngovernment investments to integrate small-scale \\nproducers into profitable and diversified value \\nchains helped farmers transition away from \\ngroundnut production by investing in poultry \\nrearing and vegetable growing, which lead to more \\nstable and increased crop incomes. 33 \\nPATHWAY 4: INTERVENING ALONG AGRIFOOD SUPPLY \\nCHAINS TO LOWER THE COST OF NUTRITIOUS FOODS \\n \\x84 Increasing investments for nutrition-sensitive \\nagricultural production and productivity; \\nincreasing efficiency of nutritious food value \\nchains; reducing nutritious food loss and waste; \\npromoting food biofortification; enacting mandatory \\nfood fortification; improving rural roads and \\ninfrastructure (e.g. nutritious food storage facilities).\\n \\x84 For example, in Myanmar, small and medium \\nenterprises have received direct transfers, \\nincreased access to new technologies and \\ntraining in sustainable production techniques to \\ndiversify food production. More than half of the \\nprogramme’s participants have seen their incomes \\nincrease by 50 percent, while the expansion of \\ntheir production to include fresh vegetables has \\nsignificantly increased the supply of nutritious \\nfoods in local markets. 30\\n| 67 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 99, 'page_label': '68'}, page_content='CHAPTER 3  A NEW DEFINITION OF FINANCING FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION\\n FIGURE 20   APPLICATION OF THE CORE AND EXTENDED DEFINITIONS OF FINANCING FOR FOOD SECURITY \\nAND NUTRITION\\nCORE DEFINITION EXTENDED DEFINITION\\nTOTAL FINANCIAL NEEDS FOR ENDING HUNGER, FOOD INSECURITY \\nAND MALNUTRITION IN ALL ITS FORMS\\nEstimated cost of building resilience to the major drivers and addressing \\nunderlying structural issues through the transformative pathways\\nMajor drivers (including underlying structural factors) of current food insecurity and malnutrition levels \\nCountry context (countries are aﬀected by which major driver or combination of drivers?)\\nTransformative pathways involved considering the country context (one or more)\\nMain determinants of food \\nsecurity and nutrition\\nLevels of hunger, food insecurity \\nand malnutrition in/uni00A0all its forms\\nEstimated cost of ending hunger, food insecurity\\nand malnutrition in all its forms\\nSOURCE: Authors’ (FAO) own elaboration.\\n BOX 9   (Continued)\\nPATHWAY 5: SHIFTING FOOD ENVIRONMENTS \\nTOWARDS HEALTHIER DIETARY PATTERNS WITH \\nPOSITIVE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH\\n \\x84 Strengthening food environments (e.g. supporting \\nhealthy public food procurement and services); \\nchanging consumer behaviour to include \\nsustainability considerations (e.g. improving trade \\nstandards with a nutrition-oriented lens, taxing \\nenergy-dense foods, introducing legislation on food \\nmarketing, food labelling and food reformulation, \\neliminating industrially produced trans fats).\\n \\x84 For example, in Chile, following the introduction of \\na law on food labelling and advertising, pre -school \\nchildren’s and adolescents’ exposure to advertising \\nfor foods high in salt, sugars, energy or saturated \\nfats dropped, while the sales of these foods in school \\nfood kiosks was banned. Purchases of foods and \\nbeverages high in salt, sugars, energy or saturated \\nfats, which were required to carry front -of-pack \\nwarning labels, also fell 24 percent following \\nintroduction of the regulation. \\nPATHWAY 6: TACKLING STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES, \\nENSURING INTERVENTIONS ARE PRO-POOR \\nAND\\xa0INCLUSIVE\\n \\x84 Empowering populations in situations of vulnerability \\nand marginalization; reducing gender inequalities \\nby supporting women’s economic activities and the \\nequitable distribution of resources; promoting the \\ninclusion of women, youth and other populations in \\nsituations of marginalization; guaranteeing access \\nto essential services; implementing fiscal reforms to \\nreduce income inequality.\\n \\x84 For example, gender inequalities are still persistent \\nacross all regions and all country income groups. \\nIn\\xa0Indonesia, a coastal community development \\nproject promoted sustainable fishery and \\naquaculture production practices by providing \\nproduction inputs and establishing processing \\nfacilities and market linkages. Women, who are \\nprimarily engaged in fish processing and marketing, \\nsaw their empowerment increase by 27 percent, \\nwhile fish productivity increased by 78 percent and \\npost-harvest losses fell by 5 percent. \\nNOTES: For more examples across the six transformation pathways see The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021 30 and the in-depth \\nreports on each of the major drivers and underlying structural factors: conflict (2017 edition), 13 climate variability and extremes (2018 edition), 34 \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns (2019 edition), 33 lack of access to and unaffordability of healthy diets (2020 edition). 29 \\nSOURCE: Adapted from FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP & WHO. 2021.

To avoid \\noverlaps in assigning financing flows, keywords \\nare identified, and decision rules constructed \\nto guide the allocation across the classification \\nlevels. See Table S3.3  for the keywords and Table\\xa0S3.4 \\nfor the decision rules in the Supplementary \\nmateria l to Chapter 3 . \\nDistinguishing financial allocations between \\n“specific” and “supportive” financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition is important. “Specific” \\nrefers to financing that contributes wholly \\nor 100 percent to food security and nutrition. \\nHowever, as discussed in Section 3.1 , there are \\nimportant financial allocations that contribute to \\nfood security and nutrition without exclusively \\nsupporting only food security and nutrition \\noutcomes. For these types of “supportive” \\nfinancing measures – those allocations that \\nonly partially contribute to food security and \\nnutrition – a weight is applied to account for the \\npercentage of their contribution to food security \\nand nutrition. The identification and application \\nof weights is fraught with challenges and \\nlimitations, due to the lack of data and evidence \\nto establish weights; however, the alternatives \\n– either to disregard supportive expenditures \\nor to include their full amounts in estimates – \\nwould present even more limitations. For the \\nmethodology, data sources and application \\nof weights, including the limitations, see \\nSection S3.2 and Table S3.3  in the  Supplementary \\nmateria l to Chapter 3 . \\nMoving from a definition of financing for \\nfood security and nutrition, to mapping it to \\nfinancial allocations is a challenging task, \\nbut one that is necessary, irrespective of \\nwhat definition is applied. Given that current \\nfinancing flows and budgets are defined on \\na sectoral basis, as\\xa0explained, it is difficult \\nto apply any definition of financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition, and to do so unavoidably \\nrequires making gross assumptions. This is \\ntrue not only for the new definition presented \\nabove, but also for all other financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition definitions applied in \\npublished studies, although this is not always \\nexplicitly staged or transparently mentioned. \\nBecause financial resources are categorized \\nby sector, there is a risk of “overcounting” or \\n“undercounting” expenditures and investments in \\nsupport of food security and nutrition and their \\nrelative importance. \\nThis report brings transparency to this \\nprocess, while also providing a new definition \\nof financing for food security and nutrition, \\nand\\xa0guidance for its application that is more in \\nline with the financing efforts needed to meet \\nSDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2. It is an initial step, going \\nforwards, to take advantage of one definition \\nthat should continue to be refined and improved. \\nWith this report, the United Nations System and \\nall governments now have an adequate definition \\nand framework for tracking the financing \\navailable and needed for food security and \\nnutrition, as part of the means of implementation \\nto meet SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2. Yet, do data \\nallow us to apply them? \\nChapter 4 shows that data to apply the new \\ndefinition of financing for food security and \\nnutrition exist only for some of the financing \\nflows; hence, it is not possible to take realistic \\nstock of how much financing is available, let\\xa0alone \\ncalculate the financing gap to support efforts to \\nmeet SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2. Therefore, data \\nsources and methodologies must be advanced to \\nensure there are better data for evidence-based \\ndecisions on financing for food security and \\nnutrition.  This report, in fact, also sends a loud \\nand clear call for better financial data that can \\nbe used for tracking financing for food security \\nand nutrition. Without this, tracking financing for \\nfood security and nutrition will remain elusive. \\nThis report thus also calls for universal adoption \\nand transparency in the use of a standardized \\napproach for operationalizing this new definition \\nin its mapping and application to financial data. n\\n»\\n| 69 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 101, 'page_label': '70'}, page_content='BRAZIL\\nAgricultural machinery \\nharvesting corn: \\nfinancing facilitates \\naccess to new \\ntechnologies.\\n©\\xa0casa.da.photo/\\nShutterstock.com'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 102, 'page_label': '71'}, page_content='CHAPTER 4 \\nCURRENT LEVELS OF AND \\nGAPS IN FINANCING TO END \\nHUNGER, FOOD INSECURITY \\nAND MALNUTRITION\\n KEY MESSAGES \\nè Financing for food security and nutrition through \\ndomestic public spending, official development \\nassistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF) is \\ntrackable, which is not the case for most private flows.\\nè Public spending on agriculture per capita is very low \\nand not steadily growing in low-income countries (LICs) \\nand lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), where \\nfood insecurity and undernutrition are more serious; \\npublic spending on agriculture is only a fraction of public \\nspending on food security and nutrition.\\nè Public spending on food security and nutrition, \\nparticularly on food consumption, was growing \\nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic in two LICs and eight \\nmiddle-income countries (MICs).

Public\\xa0finance \\nis the domestic source over which policymakers \\nhave most control for targeting food security and \\nnutrition objectives, and it is mostly used through \\ngovernment spending, which is a numerically \\ntractable flow. External public finance materializes \\nthrough flows, some of which, notably official \\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and other official \\nflows (OOF), can\\xa0also be mapped to food \\nsecurity and nutrition purposes. A portion of \\nthese external flows may be channelled through \\nnational budgets, in which case they would \\nbecome government spending. In practice, then, \\nsome financing that is relevant to food security \\nand nutrition may appear both in government \\nspending and in ODA flows that are channelled \\nthrough national budgets. In regions where ODA \\nis of paramount importance, such as sub-Saharan \\nAfrica, the execution of on-budget donor funds for \\nagriculture tends to be complex and low, and about \\n40\\xa0percent of these allocations are left unspent. 1 \\nSome ODA may be legally channelled through \\nfinancial transactions out of national budgets, to \\nimplement projects and programmes much faster. \\nAvailable data mostly allow the tracking only \\nof public spending flows, ODA (on-budget \\nand off-budget) and OOF (on-budget and \\noff-budget).

Following the definition \\nof FAO’s Monitoring and Analysing Food and \\nAgricultural Policies (MAFAP) programme, \\nthese public expenditures can be grouped \\ninto: i)\\xa0budget transfers for the provision of \\nprivate goods that are allocated to agents such \\nas producers, consumers, traders, transporters \\nand input suppliers; ii)\\xa0general support for \\nagricultural infrastructure, research and \\ndevelopment (R&D) and extension services, \\nmarketing, storage or inspection facilities, \\namong others; and iii)\\xa0administrative costs. 1 \\nThese\\xa0public expenditures may be both \\nrecurrent in nature (e.g.\\xa0to cover salaries of \\nextensionists or administrative staff) or for \\ninvestment in capital goods (e.g.\\xa0agricultural \\ninfrastructure or rural roads and electrification). \\nHowever, public spending that can affect food \\nsecurity and nutrition outcomes may also be \\nchannelled through sectors such as health \\n(e.g. public health programmes for vitamin \\nA deficiency control), and there may also be \\nimportant overlaps with social protection \\nprogrammes. This is precisely the reason why \\nit is important to rely on a broader definition of \\nfinancing – or, in this case, public spending – \\nfor\\xa0food security and nutrition.\\nIn the face of data limitations to \\ncomprehensively track government spending \\nfor the food and agriculture sector at the global \\nlevel as defined by FAO’s MAFAP programme, \\nthe general domestic government expenditure \\non agriculture per rural inhabitant (constant \\n2015 USD) at the global level is tracked, using \\ninformation from FAOSTAT. This is a more \\nlimited approach because the spending tracked \\nis not for the whole food and agriculture \\nsector but only for agriculture – hence, it is \\ninterchangeably referred to in the chapter as \\npublic spending on agriculture. Furthermore, \\nit is not possible to detect whether budget \\ntransfers for the provision of private goods are \\nequally (or unequally) allocated to individual \\nagents. As will be further shown below \\nfor selected low-income countries (LICs), \\nlower-middle-income countries (LMICs) and \\nupper-middle-income countries (UMICs), the \\npublic spending that is directly associated with \\nfood security and nutrition can be significantly \\nhigher than public spending on agriculture. \\nNotwithstanding this limitation, the\\xa0general \\ndomestic government expenditure on \\nagriculture at the global level shows interesting \\nfacts and patterns. Total general domestic \\ngovernment expenditure on agriculture had \\nbeen growing steadily since the early 2000s, \\nreaching a maximum of USD\\xa0675.4\\xa0billion \\n(constant\\xa02015\\xa0USD) in 2020, and then it declined \\nto USD\\xa0617 .3 billion in 2021. This expenditure, \\nwhen measured per rural inhabitant, barely \\nchanged between 2010 and 2021 in LICs and \\nonly saw a very slight increase in LMICs \\ntowards the last years of the period ( Figure 21). \\nIn these two country income groups, public \\nspending on agriculture was only USD\\xa08 and \\nUSD\\xa037 , respectively, per rural inhabitant, on \\naverage, in the period from 2010 to 2019. This \\npoints to how limited the financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition through public spending \\non agriculture generally is in these countries. \\nOn the other hand, governments are spending \\nmore per inhabitant where food insecurity \\nand undernutrition are, by and large, the least \\nproblematic in the world.

Much\\xa0of \\nthe existing statistical literature focuses on \\none country or region, or on HICs; on limited \\nor approximative food security and nutrition \\nindicators; on one public expenditure sector, \\ngenerally agriculture given its most direct \\nassociation with food security and nutrition; or \\non outcomes such as growth or poverty reduction \\nthat may be related to food security and nutrition \\nbut are distinct from them. Furthermore,\\xa0existing \\nstudies may not control for other factors that \\naffect food security and nutrition or consider \\ngovernment policies that do not involve \\nsignificant expenditure. \\nCross-country evidence for 65 countries \\n(including 11 HICs) indicates that greater public \\nspending on agriculture, social protection and \\nhealth was associated with reduced stunting. 3 \\nThis has also been partially corroborated by an \\nanalysis for nine Southern African countries, \\nwhich found a favourable association between \\npublic spending on agriculture, average dietary \\nenergy supply adequacy and the prevalence of \\nundernourishment (PoU). 4 Significant impacts \\non food security indicators (i.e. average dietary \\nenergy supply adequacy, domestic food price \\nindex, domestic food price volatility, and \\nproportion of population using improved \\nsanitation facilities) have also been found \\nfor public spending on agricultural R&D in \\nAfrica and also for general public expenditure \\nin agriculture, but only for the countries that \\nallocate the larger proportions of their budgets \\nto agriculture. 5\\nOur analysis corroborates that public spending \\non agriculture correlates in expected ways \\nwith most – albeit not all – food security \\nand nutrition outcomes, even if it is only a \\npart, and sometimes even a small one, of all \\nthe public spending on food security and \\nnutrition, as will be further shown below for \\nsome countries. This\\xa0is an analysis of observed \\nassociation, which does not imply a causal \\nrelationship and can be affected by the income \\nlevel of a country, among other factors. Still, \\nit shows that the lower the general domestic \\ngovernment expenditure on agriculture per \\ncapita, the larger the PoU in 87\\xa0LICs, LMICs and \\nUMICs ( Figure\\xa022 A). In more than half of these \\n(49\\xa0countries), the PoU is above 10\\xa0percent, \\nand governments in most of these countries \\n(39\\xa0countries, mostly LICs and LMICs) spent \\non average USD\\xa020 per person or less between \\n2017 and 2019.

Regarding obesity, for example, \\nthe\\xa0literature overwhelmingly focuses on HICs \\nand looks much more often into the consequences \\nof obesity on public expenditure (especially in \\nthe health sector) than into the possible effects of \\npublic expenditure on obesity. It finds a positive \\nassociation between overweight and public \\nexpenditure on agriculture, social protection \\nand health. 3 Social spending in Organisation \\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development \\n(OECD) countries (mainly on early childhood \\neducation and care) has also been found to \\nhave a favourable impact on obesity among \\nchildren aged 5 to 19\\xa0years, after controlling \\nfor other factors. 6\\nOur correlation analysis, which encompasses \\nLICs and MICs instead of HICs, indicates that \\nthe more governments spend on agriculture, \\nthe more countries exhibit a high percentage \\nof children under five years of age who are \\noverweight – with a correlation coefficient of \\n0.27 for 105 LICs, LMICs and UMICs ( Figure 22 D). \\nThere may be several explanations for this, \\nwhich merit more empirical exploration in future \\neditions of this report. One could be that a higher \\nprevalence of overweight among children may \\nprompt governments to spend more on some \\nnutrition-related programmes, although this \\nresponse may not necessarily be overwhelmingly \\nhappening through national budgets for \\nagriculture. Another hypothetical explanation \\nis that public spending on agriculture does not \\nsupport enough nutrition -sensitive actions, nor \\ndoes it enable healthy food environments. As seen \\nin previous editions of this report, not only are \\nhealthy diets unaffordable for billions, but also \\nfood environments are not conducive to healthy \\ndiets. 7 The world is also not producing sufficient \\nfruits and vegetables and other nutritious foods \\nfor a growing population demanding them \\nmore, including in rural areas. 8 Public support \\nto the food and agriculture sector, including \\nfiscal subsidies, has also created incentives to \\nincrease the availability and reduce the price of \\nstaple foods and their derivatives – including \\nhighly processed foods high in unhealthy fats, \\nsugars and/or salt and of minimal nutritional \\nvalue – while at the same time discouraging \\nand making relatively more expensive the \\nconsumption of unsubsidized or less subsidized \\ncommodities such as fruits, vegetables and \\npulses. 2 Unsurprisingly, as seen in Chapter 2 , \\nmillions of children under five years of age are \\nexperiencing overweight. \\nOverweight may also be more highly \\ncorrelated with public spending in the health \\nsector compared with public spending in \\nthe agriculture sector. However, not only is \\nthere a positive correlation between general \\ndomestic government expenditure on treatment \\nof nutritional deficiencies per capita and the \\npercentage of children under five years of age \\nwho are overweight (not shown graphically \\nhere), but this correlation is also similar to that \\nseen above for public spending on agriculture \\n(i.e.\\xa0coefficient of correlation equivalent to \\n0.33).n It may very well be the case that LICs \\nand MICs that spend more on nutritional \\ndeficiencies are also those countries with higher \\nlevels of overweight and obesity – but this \\nhypothesis needs further exploration. Clearly, \\nnot only will more domestic public finance \\nbe needed to support public spending on \\nagriculture, but\\xa0countries, particularly LMICs \\nand UMICs, will need to invest more heavily \\nin nutrition-sensitive agriculture and healthier \\nfood environments to address the problems of \\noverweight and\\xa0obesity more effectively. \\nThe association between public spending \\non agriculture and food security and \\nnutrition outcomes at the global level is likely \\nweakened by inefficiencies in the actual public \\nexpenditures. The association between public \\nspending on food security and nutrition and \\nfood security and nutrition outcomes is expected \\nto be relatively stronger because, as shall be \\nnoted below, public spending on agriculture is \\nonly a small fraction of public spending on food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nn Interestingly, but not shown here, general domestic government \\nexpenditure on nutritional deficiencies per capita (current purchasing \\npower parity [PPP]) is negatively associated with the PoU (coefficient of \\ncorrelation = −0.07), the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity \\n(coefficient of correlation = −0.32), and stunting (coefficient of \\ncorrelation\\xa0=\\xa0−0.35). The data come from WHO’s System of Health \\nAccounts; it covers 40 LICs, LMICs and UMICs, of which 33 are in \\nsub-Saharan Africa; it excludes China and India; three outliers are also \\nexcluded from the analysis: Armenia and South Africa for public \\nexpenditure, and Tunisia for overweight.\\n»\\n| 77 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 109, 'page_label': '78'}, page_content='CHAPTER 4  CURRENT LEVELS OF AND GAPS IN FINANCING TO END HUNGER, FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION\\nPublic spending on food security and nutrition \\nin selected low-income countries and \\nmiddle-income countries\\nReadily available public spending data do not \\nexist for all the countries in the world to apply \\nthe core and extended definitions of financing \\nfor food security and nutrition introduced in \\nChapter\\xa03 – so as to arrive at a global aggregate \\nof this financing.

This issue, which also exists \\nfor public spending on food and agriculture, is \\neven more acute for the private sector. This\\xa0is \\nthe case, particularly because the private sector \\nmay not necessarily be investing its resources \\nin agrifood-related business in ways that \\nalways help reduce hunger, food insecurity \\n BOX 10   SOME PRIVATE INVESTMENTS CAN HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 2\\nOn food security, a recent study ran a meta-regression \\nanalysis of 24 studies that found little evidence for either \\nnegative or positive effects of foreign direct investment \\n(FDI) on food security in developing countries, although \\nit did suggest that the effect might be positive in the \\nshort term but negative in the long term. 12 \\nOn nutrition, however, The Lancet, in its \\n“Commercial determinants of health” series, 13 observed \\nin 2023 that a substantial group of commercial actors \\nare escalating avoidable levels of ill health, planetary \\ndamage, and inequity – the commercial determinants \\nof health. Similarly, a review of quantitative evidence \\nconducted in 2019 14 found that FDI appears to be \\nmore clearly associated with increases in overweight, \\nobesity and non-communicable disease prevalence than \\nwith changes in undernutrition. In addition, a network \\nanalysis revealed that many of the large players in the \\nglobal food and beverage industries are at the centre of \\ninterest groups representing the “ultra-processed food” \\nindustry. 15\\nTwo recent studies in the British Medical Journal  \\nhighlight that hundreds of epidemiological studies and \\nmeta-analyses have reported associations between \\n“ultra-processed food” consumption and adverse \\nhealth outcomes. 16, 17  A review of 35 550 products \\nmanufactured by the global top 20 food and beverage \\ncompanies (representing 22 percent of worldwide \\nsales in the sector) in a few key countries including \\nBrazil, China, India and South Africa found that the \\noverwhelming majority were unhealthy according to \\nthe World Health Organization Regional Office for \\nEurope nutrient profile model, with a small number of \\nsignificant exceptions. In these four countries, healthier \\nproducts accounted for just 4–12 percent of the 2020 \\nsales of these companies. 18\\nAs far as environmental impacts are concerned, \\n“ultra-processed foods” are associated with intensive \\nagriculture and livestock and threaten all dimensions of \\nagrifood systems sustainability due to the combination \\nof low-cost ingredients at purchase and increased \\nconsumption worldwide. 19 Similarly, “ultra-processed \\nfood” production and consumption have been found \\nto have impacts on land degradation, herbicide use, \\neutrophication and packaging use. 20\\n| 88 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 120, 'page_label': '89'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nand malnutrition.

The different \\nanalyses available may have a different first year \\nfor the base scenario, which affects the period \\nof analysis and, hence, the cost estimates for \\nthe period from that first year to 2030 (or any \\nother final year). \\nBecause not all the relevant pillars of food \\nsecurity and not all the forms of malnutrition \\nare systematically accounted for in existing \\nstudies, the cost estimates are only partial. \\nFurthermore, because the quantitative methods \\ndiffer across studies, the focus is mostly on the \\ncost of new policies and interventions (which \\nis the most comparable aspect across studies) \\nand less on the resources mobilized for private \\ninvestment and household food consumption in \\nresponse to the policies and interventions, the \\nmagnitude of which is also important for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nWhile these global analyses provide useful \\ncostings for different policies and interventions, \\nit is not possible to know whether these \\npolicies and interventions can realistically be \\nfinanced in practice to the extent estimated, \\nnot to mention the macroeconomic trade-offs \\nof using one source of finance over another, \\nand countries’ absorptive capacity for foreign \\nresources and for fully executing newly available \\nfinancing. These\\xa0are important considerations \\nat the country level as shown by a body of \\nCGE modelling literature. v,\\xa027  The global cost \\nestimates here presented operate under the \\nassumption that all the financing needed is \\navailable, which may not necessarily be the \\ncase for countries that have no easy access to \\ngrant aid or borrowing, or where there is no \\npolitical feasibility to raise taxes. They also \\nassume that countries that have access to such \\nfinancing have full absorptive capacity, meaning \\nthat their economies can properly adjust to \\nany local currency appreciation from foreign \\nexchange inflows, which may also not be the \\ncase for some countries. The cost estimates \\nmust be taken with the assumption that the \\nadditional annual costs estimated by the studies \\nfor past years (i.e.\\xa0before 2024) were never \\nfully borne, because the exact investments and \\ninterventions whose costs are estimated were \\nnot necessarily implemented. Furthermore, \\nthese global analyses assume that groups of \\ncountries or regions implement the same policies \\nand interventions in unison, which in practice \\nwould require a comprehensive global accord. \\nThe financial cost associated with enacting new \\nlegislation, which is a key tool for improving \\nv Existing global model-based analyses, such as those referred to \\nhere, include, for each country or region, a current account balance \\n(that can be in surplus or deficit) for the domestic economic institutions \\n(i.e. households, enterprises and the government) and the rest of the \\nworld. These domestic and foreign balances are summed up to estimate \\nthe total savings to which total investment is equalized for each country \\nor region. With some refinement, some of these global models may have \\na current account balance for each institution. However, they do not \\ninclude a capital account for each economic institution that allows \\nmapping up institutions’ surpluses and deficits to specific sources of \\ndomestic and foreign financing. The body of CGE modelling literature at \\nthe country level referred to here includes capital accounts for each \\neconomic institution and recognizes the different potential \\nmacroeconomic trade-offs from using alternative ways of financing \\npublic investment, although its focus is on country-level applications. \\n»\\n| 92 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 124, 'page_label': '93'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\n TABLE 17   OVERVIEW OF STUDIES WITH COST ESTIMATES FOR ENDING HUNGER, FOOD INSECURITY \\nAND\\xa0MALNUTRITION\\nStudy Main question \\nasked\\nTargets and time \\nframe \\nModelling \\napproach\\nAdditional annual \\ncosts up to 2030 \\n(unless otherwise \\nindicated) for a \\nspecific period\\nInvestments/interventions \\nFAO, IFAD \\nand WFP \\n(2015)\\nWhat are the \\nadditional \\ntransfers and \\ninvestments \\nneeded to end \\npoverty and \\nhunger in all \\ncountries by \\n2030?\\nNo Poverty and \\nZero Hunger \\ntargets by 2030.\\nGlobal partial \\nequilibrium \\nmodel with \\ncountry \\nprojections of \\nfood supply and \\ndemand (called \\nGAPS).\\nUSD 265 billion \\nper year, of which \\nUSD 198 billion \\nfor pro-poor \\ninvestments \\n(2016–2030).\\nPoverty gap transfers and pro-poor \\ninvestments in irrigation, genetic \\nresources, mechanization, primary \\nagriculture and natural resources, \\nagroprocessing operations, \\ninfrastructure, institutional framework, \\nresearch and development (R&D), \\nextension; social protection.\\nGlobal \\nNutrition \\nReport \\n(2021)\\nWhat is the \\nminimum cost to \\nmeet the World \\nHealth Assembly \\n(WHA) goals on \\nreducing \\nundernutrition by \\n2030?\\n40% reduction in \\nchild stunting; \\n50% reduction in \\nanaemia in \\nwomen; \\n50%\\xa0increase in \\nexclusive \\nbreastfeeding \\nrates; child \\nwasting at 5%.\\nInvestment cost \\nminimization and \\ncost–benefit \\nanalysis.\\nUSD 10.8 billion \\nper year \\n(2022–2030).\\nTargeted nutrition interventions \\n(micronutrient and protein \\nsupplementation, promoting good \\nhealth and hygiene, complementary \\nfoods) and select nutrition-sensitive \\ninterventions (staple food fortification \\nand pro-breastfeeding policies).\\nLaborde \\net\\xa0al.

Some \\ncase studies embrace the premise that hunger \\nstems from a deficiency in purchasing power, \\nresulting in lack of access to sufficient, safe and \\nnutritious food. Consequently, achieving the \\ngoal of eliminating hunger (SDG\\xa02) is contingent \\nupon eliminating poverty (SDG\\xa01) and upon \\nbroader economy-wide investments that boost \\nGDP growth and people’s incomes. FAO, IFAD \\nand WFP (2015) 28 estimated that USD 265 billion \\nper year are needed to eliminate hunger, of \\nwhich USD 198 billion per year would be for \\ntargeted pro-poor private and public investments, \\nespecially in rural areas and agriculture. \\nIn several studies, increasing agricultural \\nproductivity through new investments is seen as \\na channel to reduce hunger. It has been estimated \\n– using a global economy-wide model – that \\ninvesting an additional USD 52 billion annually \\nbetween 2015 and 2030 to boost agricultural \\nproductivity in the face of climate change in LICs \\nand MICs would fill the yield gaps and reduce the \\nPoU to 10 percent in Eastern and Central African \\ncountries and to 5 percent in all other countries. 29 \\nSome studies focus on the most vulnerable \\nhouseholds in all countries. A global \\neconomy-wide modelling study projects that \\nthe number of hungry people would decrease to \\n599 million from 2015 to 2030, primarily driven \\nby economic growth, and to reduce this number \\nto 310 million (or the PoU to 5 percent) by 2025, \\na policy mix would be needed. This includes a \\nreallocation of public spending for countries to \\nprioritize social safety nets supporting consumers \\nthrough cash transfers and food stamps; farm \\nsupport to increase production and farmers’ \\nincomes; and investments in infrastructure, \\neducation, storage, market access and value \\nchains. This policy mix results in an overall cost \\nof USD 11 billion annually between 2015 and \\n2030 – of which USD 4 billion are expected to \\ncome from donor contributions and the remaining \\nUSD 7 billion from countries themselves. \\nThese\\xa0measures are also projected to stimulate \\nan additional USD 5 billion in private investment \\nper\\xa0year, on average. 30 \\nAnother global economy-wide modelling study \\nidentifies 14 policy interventions that are \\nclustered into three categories to, respectively: \\ni)\\xa0directly assist farmers, including through \\nprovision of farm inputs, research and \\ndevelopment, improved livestock feed, and \\nirrigation infrastructure; ii)\\xa0reduce post-harvest \\nlosses through measures such as storage \\nimprovement, enhancing returns from sales, \\nand supporting services offered by SMEs; and \\niii)\\xa0empower excluded populations through social \\nprotection and vocational training programmes. \\nIt estimates that USD 33 billion per year would \\nbe needed between 2020 and 2030 to support \\nthese public interventions and reduce the PoU to \\n3 percent – of which USD 14 billion from donors \\nand the remaining USD 19 billion from domestic \\nresource mobilization. These public interventions \\nwould increase the profitability of primary and \\nprocessed food sectors, attracting the private \\nsector to invest USD 52 billion per year on average \\nin such sectors. 31\\nUsing marginal cost curve analysis – a simpler \\napproach that does not account for economy-wide \\neffects – helped to estimate the additional costs \\nassociated with lifting people out of hunger \\nthrough 24 interventions that have been proven \\nto be the least-cost measures with significant \\npotential for reducing hunger and malnutrition. \\nThese include a mix of enhancing efficiency \\nin agricultural R&D, expanding agricultural \\nextension services, improving agricultural \\ninformation services, expanding small-scale \\nirrigation in Africa, enhancing female literacy \\nrates, and scaling up existing social safety \\nnets. They would require an additional annual \\ninvestment of about USD 39 to 50 billion to lift \\napproximately 840 to 909 million people out of \\nhunger by 2030. 32\\nAn investment cost minimization and cost–benefit \\napproach helped estimate the minimum cost \\nto meet four of the six World Health Assembly \\ntargets by 2025: i)\\xa0reducing the number of stunted \\nchildren under the age of five by 40 percent; \\nii)\\xa0reducing the number of women at reproductive \\nage with anaemia by 50\\xa0percent; iii)\\xa0increasing \\nthe rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first \\nsix months to 50 percent; and iv)\\xa0reducing and \\nmaintaining child wasting at less than 5\\xa0percent. \\nThis study aligns with SDG Target 2.2 but does \\n| 96 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 128, 'page_label': '97'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nnot fully cover it – as, for example, interventions \\nto address child overweight are not included \\n– and the study leaves out SDG Target\\xa02.1. \\nIt\\xa0estimates that an additional USD 7 billion per \\nyear is needed between 2015 and 2025 to achieve \\nthese four global nutrition targets through \\nnutrition-specific investments in micronutrient \\nsupplementation, good infant and young child \\nnutrition practices, and staple food fortification. 33 \\nTo include additional costs for mitigating the \\nimpact of the COVID -19 pandemic, this cost \\nestimate was updated to USD 10.8 billion per year, \\nand the period of analysis was extended to 2030 \\n(rather than 2025) from 2022. 34 \\nCost estimates jump sharply when \\ntransformational policies and interventions \\nto increase the affordability of healthy diets \\nare factored in.

The first way to examine the cost of \\nnot bridging the financing gap is by measuring \\nthe millions of people that, by 2030 and beyond, \\nwill still be hungry, food insecure, malnourished \\nand unable to afford a healthy diet, not to mention \\nthe medium- to long-term socioeconomic and \\nhealth repercussions of this food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. \\nThe second way to examine the cost of inaction \\nrelates to the inefficiency, inequity and lack of \\nsustainability with which current financing \\nis being spent and allocated. In this section, \\nreference is also made to the opportunity cost \\nof not efficiently implementing and allocating \\npublic funds that are important for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nNot bridging the financing gap will make \\nhunger, food insecurity, malnutrition \\nand\\xa0unhealthy living prevail while \\ncosting\\xa0trillions\\nChapter 2 provides stark evidence of what \\nbusiness as usual means for hunger, food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition.

Furthermore, \\nit notes that regarding civil servants’ salaries, \\nwhich are more predictable and easier to \\nimplement than investments, the relative share \\nof public spending in the agriculture sector is \\nmuch lower than in other sectors. The significant \\nreliance on donor funds, that are more difficult \\nto implement, further contributes to the low \\nexecution rates of agricultural budgets. It should \\nbe noted, however, that execution rates can \\nvary across sectors even within infrastructures. \\nA World Bank study found execution ratios \\nof 94 percent for roads versus only 75 percent \\nfor the power sector, 55 and differences in \\nexecution rates can even be observed within one \\ncountry over time,  even over short periods, as is \\nshown in public expenditure reviews for some \\nAfrican countries. x\\nSome of the financing available may nonetheless \\nnot be utilized in the most cost-effective, equitable \\nand environmentally sustainable manner in \\ncountries across all income groups.

This opportunity cost may itself \\nbe important to reduce the financing gap to \\nmeet SDG Targets\\xa02.1 and\\xa02.2. The 2022 edition \\nof this report 2 analysed several scenarios of \\nrepurposing some of the worldwide support \\nto food and agriculture, which\\xa0accounted for \\nalmost USD 630 billion per year, on average \\nover the period from 2013 to 2018. It\\xa0showed that \\nrepurposing some of this support to increase the \\navailability of nutritious foods to consumers, in \\nparticular, can result in making a healthy diet \\nless costly and more affordable, globally and \\nparticularly in MICs. The scenarios showed the \\npotential global gains of repurposing in terms \\nof GDP growth, poverty reduction, and GHG \\nemissions reduction. A\\xa0similar study by the \\nWorld Bank and the International Food Policy \\nResearch Institute for 79\\xa0countries (including \\nOECD member states) found that the bulk of \\ntransfers to producers are provided through \\nmeasures that the OECD refers to as “potentially \\nmost distorting” , and they amounted to \\nUSD\\xa0456 billion per year from 2016 to 2018. For \\na scenario where a portion of said support is \\nrepurposed for increased spending on green \\ninnovations, this study finds that by 2040, global \\nreal income would increase by 1.6 percent while \\nglobal extreme poverty, the cost of a healthy diet, \\nand overall emissions from agriculture would \\ndecrease by, respectively, 1 percent, 18 percent \\nand 40 percent compared to a business -as-usual \\nprojection. 58 No doubt, repurposing some of \\nthe worldwide support to food and agriculture \\nis an important move to improve food security \\nand nutrition outcomes and this would help \\nto reduce the financing needed to meet \\nSDG\\xa0Targets 2.1 and 2.2. \\nIn practice, however, governments in LICs, \\nbut\\xa0also perhaps in some LMICs, do not provide \\nsignificant support to food and agriculture due \\nto fiscal constraints.

For instance, one study found a \\nnegative association between ODA grants and \\ntax revenues, particularly in LICs. 24 Another 25 \\nshowed that some grants from international \\ndevelopment flows include conditionalities \\nsuch as increases in tax revenues over time and \\nreductions in external debt through borrowing. \\nHowever, as indicated above, countries with \\nlimited ability to access financing in most cases \\nare not able to increase tax revenues. Therefore, \\na country’s reduction in borrowing and the \\ninability to increase tax revenues can lead to \\nfewer available resources and, in turn, place a \\nlower‑than‑expected expenditure on the sector to \\nwhich the grant was directed. \\nCountries with limited ability to access \\nfinancing have high levels of sovereign debt \\nand must spend significant amounts of public \\nrevenue on servicing debt. For these countries, \\nai The term “Dutch Disease” refers to the discovery of large natural \\ngas deposits in the territorial sea of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \\nwhich led to a rapid rise in revenues and the consequent appreciation of \\nthe national currency; as a result, other sectors’ exports were more \\nexpensive (and imports for the same sectors cheaper), reducing their \\ncompetitivity. The phenomenon is often associated with the discovery of \\nnatural resources, but it can occur in the case of any sudden inflow of \\nforeign currency. 21\\naj The paper calls it “nutrition-sensitive ODA” and includes the \\nfollowing categories from the database of the Development Assistance \\nCommittee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \\nDevelopment (OECD): food aid/food security programs (CRS code \\n52010), emergency food assistance (72040), reproductive health care \\n(13020), basic health care (12220), material relief assistance and \\nservices (72010), STD control including HIV/AIDS (13040), urban \\ndevelopment and management (43030), agricultural development \\n(31120) and agricultural research (31182). 23\\ndebt\\xa0swaps and debt relief measures can allow the \\nreallocation of resources towards food security \\nand nutrition. ak \\nIn sum, in countries with limited ability \\nto access financing, the role of donors and \\nother development institutions in delivering \\ninternational development flows is essential to \\nfill the financing gap for meeting SDG\\xa0Targets\\xa02.1 \\nand 2.2. In countries with moderate ability to \\naccess financing, utilizing concessional finance \\nand commerce ‑oriented instruments following a \\nblended finance approach al will still be essential \\nfor de ‑risking investments and providing the \\nright incentives for private actors to participate in \\nthese markets. However, while moving towards \\nlower levels of risk, it is expected that public \\nand private actors can progressively increase \\ntheir engagement, making more financing flows \\navailable (i.e. more affordable).\\nMobilizing domestic tax revenues is more \\nfeasible in countries with moderate ability to \\naccess financing (see Figure 32). Deepening the tax \\nbase could reduce some countries’ dependence \\non concessional finance (or commercial loans \\nand debt), and in several countries, there is \\nthe potential to increase tax revenues from \\ntheir current levels. 26 However, as mentioned, \\nthe potential expansion of tax revenues has \\nincome as a strong determinant (the higher the \\nGDP per capita, the higher the tax potential), \\nas\\xa0well as other factors such as the composition \\nand formalization of national economies, and \\ninstitutional and governance mechanisms. am \\nSome\\xa0scholars have studied countries’ “tax\\xa0effort” \\n(the ratio of actual tax collection to tax potential) \\nto analyse whether there is space to improve \\nmobilization of domestic resources.

Therefore, these \\ninstruments are recommended for all country \\ngroups in Figure 32 . \\nScaling up private financing is essential for \\nmeeting SDG\\xa0Targets 2.1 and 2.2 because \\nof its well ‑known role in overall economic \\ndevelopment, and for the simple reason that \\nfunding from other financing flows like \\ninternational development flows or public \\nbudgets is not sufficient to fill the financing gap \\nto end hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. \\nFor instance, foreign direct investment (FDI) \\nhas an important role for LICs and MICs, but \\nits effects may vary depending on a country’s \\nincome level and the sector of the FDI.

On the \\nother hand, all kinds of FDI positively impact \\nGDP growth in HICs. 29 Foreign direct investment \\ndirected to agriculture has also been shown to \\nincrease agricultural production in LICs and \\nMICs, and its effects are higher when these are \\ncombined with agricultural ODA. 30 Nevertheless, \\nas\\xa0indicated, LICs have mostly limited ability to \\naccess financing, making private financing flows \\ncostly and rarely available. How can countries \\nreduce their financial risk to attract other \\nsources of financing? \\nFigure 32  provides recommendations for financing \\ninstruments, depending on a country’s ability \\nto access financing flows, as assessed in Table 18. \\nPrivate financing flows (e.g. equity investments, \\nbonds and commercial rate loans), as well as \\npublic domestic financing (e.g. taxes), are more \\naffordable as countries’ financial risk decreases, \\nmaking them more suitable options; on the other \\nhand, international development flows and \\nconcessional finance (e.g. grants, low ‑interest \\nloans and debt swaps) are the best alternative in \\ncontexts of high financial risk, as other options \\ncould be too expensive. While Figure 32  proposes \\nexamples of financing instruments that could fit \\neach category and be used to increase a country’s \\nability to access financing (as analysed in detail \\nin Section 5.2), the most effective way to increase \\na country’s financial options is undoubtedly \\nto address the determinants of their ability to \\naccess financing. Addressing these development \\nchallenges can result in win–win solutions; \\nfor instance, sound economic and monetary \\npolicies that reward savings and deepen capital \\nmarkets are essential for creating a better \\nenvironment for private investments. Improving \\ntax systems not only increases the financing \\nflows needed to fill the funding gap, but can \\nalso lead, through public expenditure, to gains \\nin economic growth and inequality reduction. \\nThe strategic adoption of digital technology can \\nmake tax collection easier and lead to enhanced \\ntransparency, which is key for building trust in \\nnational public administrations. 31 Reducing and \\nmaking sovereign debt levels more manageable \\nis an essential requisite for mobilizing the \\nfinancing needed to implement urgent food \\nsecurity and nutrition actions, as well as \\npolicies to build resilience to the major drivers \\nof food insecurity and malnutrition. 8 Therefore, \\nbetter macroeconomic management for income \\ngrowth, reducing a country’s sovereign risk and \\ndebt, and strengthening national institutions \\nand governance, are essential, not only from a \\nfinancial perspective, but also from the overall \\ndevelopment perspective of the countries \\nmost affected by hunger, food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. n\\n| 113 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 145, 'page_label': '114'}, page_content='CHAPTER 5  WHAT IS NEEDED TO CATALYSE SCALABLE FINANCING TO FILL THE GAP?\\n5.2\\nINNOVATIVE FINANCING \\nAPPROACHES AND \\nTOOLS TO BRIDGE THE \\nFINANCING GAP FOR \\nSDG\\xa0TARGETS 2.1 AND 2.2\\nThe adoption of innovative financing instruments \\nwill be essential for scaling up food security and \\nnutrition financing flows to meet SDG Targets\\xa02.1 \\nand\\xa02.2.

Climate-related destruction and \\ndisasters necessitate substantial investments, but\\xa0their \\nfiscal space is constrained as a significant portion \\nof resources must be allocated to debt servicing. 42 \\nThe debt servicing obligations of 58 of the low- and \\nmiddle-income countries (LICs and MICs) most \\nvulnerable to climate change are projected to reach \\nnearly USD 500 billion between 2023 and 2026. 42 \\nFor countries struggling with both unsustainable \\npublic debt and high levels of food insecurity and/or \\nmalnutrition among their population, the situation is \\nsimilarly dire. Substantial debt servicing obligations \\nimpede the ability of governments to invest in crucial \\nfood security and nutrition policies. They reduce foreign \\nexchange reserves otherwise available for food imports \\nand hamper investments in health, nutrition and \\neducation, critical for enhancing future human capital \\nand laying the foundation for sustainable pathways \\nout of food insecurity and malnutrition. The analysis in \\nSection\\xa05.1 underscores the large number of countries \\nstruggling with this double challenge: Out of 119\\xa0LICs \\nand MICs, 75 have limited or moderate access to any \\nfinancing flow (see\\xa0Table\\xa018).\\nIn the three decades up to 2017, debt swaps \\nhave alleviated governmental liabilities amounting \\nto USD\\xa02.6\\xa0billion in exchange for investments \\nin development or climate action totalling \\nUSD\\xa01.2\\xa0billion. 41 The bulk of these transactions \\ncomprise modest-sized bilateral, directly negotiated \\nbetween debtor and creditor countries. 41 To date, \\ncreditors have been Paris Club countries.* Recent \\nyears have witnessed heightened attention towards \\ndebt-for-climate swaps. Current transactions, such as \\nthose in Belize, Ecuador and Gabon, have individually \\nreached volumes of USD\\xa01.6\\xa0billion, USD\\xa0553\\xa0million \\nand USD\\xa0500\\xa0million, respectively. 43–45 In 2023, \\nChina, the largest bilateral creditor for LICs and \\nMICs, signed a first memorandum of understanding \\nwith Egypt to negotiate a debt swap for development \\nprojects. 46, 47  Although still considered a niche \\nfinancial instrument, debt-for -climate swaps hold \\nimmense potential, with an estimated market size of \\nUSD\\xa0800 billion. 42, 48\\nThese recent debt-for-climate swaps – so-called \\ntripartite swaps – involve development partners as \\nfinancial intermediaries providing loans to debtor \\ncountries for the repurchase of debt. The loans are \\ncontingent upon the recipient country’s commitment \\nto introduce and implement nature or climate \\npolicy measures. Financing for these loans typically \\ninvolves labelled bonds (see details on green bonds \\nin this chapter), bolstered by support from donors \\nor guarantees from multilateral banks, enabling \\nfavourable credit terms including beyond market \\ninterest rates and maturities. 41 This approach allows \\nboth bilateral swapping and swapping of privately \\nheld debt. It further broadens refinancing options \\nand offers a lifeline to countries excluded from \\ncredit markets. \\nGiven the critical challenges posed by \\nunsustainable debt burdens and high levels of food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition in many countries, \\nexchanging debt for food emerges as a practical \\nsolution with good potential. Debt-for-food security \\nswaps have already been instrumental in addressing \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition. Noteworthy initiatives, \\nsuch as home-grown school feeding and social \\nprotection programmes, have been supported. In the \\ncurrent situation, where some countries’ food import \\nvolumes have fallen, leveraging freed-up foreign \\nexchange through debt relief to procure essential \\nfoodstuffs on international markets presents a \\nviable option.\\nTo date, debt-for-food security swaps have been \\nused primarily to swap bilateral debt. 41 In practice, \\nthey are typically executed through development \\npartners to ensure effective implementation, \\ntransparency, mutual accountability and thorough \\nmonitoring and evaluation.

Even so, insuring agrifood \\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) and smallholder \\nfarmers is still very challenging, and important public \\nor donor subsidies are often needed to make insurance \\nwork for them. 57 In fact, insurance coverage remains \\nvery low in low- and middle-income countries due \\nto its high premium costs and the low awareness of \\nits benefits among agrifood SMEs and smallholder \\nfarmers. 58 For example, out of 600 million farmers in \\nAfrica, only 600\\xa0000 possess insurance coverage. 59 \\nWomen, particularly in rural areas, face more challenges \\nthan men to access insurance products, due to their \\nlack of resources and lower levels of financial literacy, \\nthe distrust of financial institutions, and discriminatory \\nsocial norms and policies that may prevent them from \\nsigning legal contracts without male signatories. As a \\nresult, they tend to acquire lower value coverage. 60 \\nInnovative insurance tools include yield-index \\ninsurance, parametric/index-based weather insurance \\nand trade credit insurance. 61 Case studies from \\nsub-Saharan Africa have shown that the adequate \\ncombination of de-risking instruments depending \\non the national and subnational context is key for \\nmaximizing their impact in rural contexts. In addition, \\nit is important to include technical assistance \\ncomponents and implement them before engaging the \\nbeneficiaries with other rural finance instruments. 62 \\nIn particular, parametric insurance  is a valuable \\ninstrument for managing agricultural risks associated \\nwith weather-related events such as droughts, floods \\nor extreme temperatures, contributing to reducing \\nrisks by offering a dependable income source in \\nthe face of weather-induced crop failures (Figure 33). \\nParametric insurance is typically used to complement \\ntraditional insurance. While conventional insurance \\nrefunds adjusted losses suffered by policyholders \\ncaused by an insured peril, up to the policy limit, \\nparametric insurance pays out a specified sum when a \\ncertain, very specific event occurs – the “parameter” . \\nHowever, the implementation of parametric \\ninsurance can be financially burdensome, \\nencompassing expenses associated with data \\ncollection, index development and administrative \\noperations. These elevated costs often translate \\ninto higher premiums, impeding the affordability of \\ninsurance coverage. Moreover, parametric insurance \\nmay not comprehensively address all risks, for example, \\nthose stemming from pests, diseases or market \\nfluctuations. Consequently, farmers remain exposed \\nto losses outside the coverage scope of the insurance \\nscheme. 34 These\\xa0challenges have been addressed in \\nsome countries using risk pools, which are groups of \\nstakeholders that band together to share insurance \\nresources and costs (Figure 33). For example, in 2023, \\nthe African Risk Capacity (ARC) Group, comprising \\ntwo agencies* from the African Union, which provides \\ninsurance services through risk pooling, launched \\na new parametric insurance mechanism for African \\ncountries to cope with the devastating effects of \\nflooding. This product provides countries with \\npredictable and rapid financing for early response to \\ncope with emergency disaster events caused by floods \\n(Pathway\\xa02). The flood product generates daily flood \\nanalysis and calculates the associated impacts for each \\ncountry. These impacts are compared to the parametric \\ntriggers (economic losses or the number of people \\naffected), and pay-outs are calculated if flood impacts \\nexceed the trigger threshold defined by the country. 63\\nThere are also interesting examples of parametric \\ninsurance in countries with limited access to financing \\nflows. Pula, an insurtech** company, together with the \\nWorld Food Programme’s Rural Resilience Initiative \\n(R4) in Kenya, allows farmers to access a combination \\nof crop insurance and risk reduction practices which \\nprotect them from the impact of climatic shocks \\n(Pathway\\xa02).*** Specifically, the initiative invests in \\nthe Area Yield Insurance Index (AYII) in support of \\ngovernment efforts to offer microinsurance coverage \\nto farmers. The AYII adopts ecological zones as a way \\nof measuring unit areas for insurance compared to \\nthe previous administrative boundaries. This method \\nreduces the risk basis and provides fairer compensation \\nto farmers. 64 \\nIn Rwanda, the Ministry of Agriculture and \\nAnimal Resources initiated the National Agriculture \\nInsurance Scheme in collaboration with three \\ninsurance firms: SONARWA Life, Prime Insurance and \\nRADIANT. The programme involved governmental \\nsubsidies covering 40\\xa0percent of the premiums \\nfor weather-indexed and yield-indexed insurance \\n(Pathway\\xa02).

For example, income-linked \\nsovereign bonds have gained attention since \\nthe onset of debt crisis situations such as \\nthe 2008–2009 financial crisis; they link the \\nobligation to pay to countries with an indicator \\nof the ability to pay, thus reducing the risk of \\ndefaults ( Pathway\\xa03). These bonds can create \\nimportant welfare gains and allow national \\nfiscal policies to be more stable and predictable. 69 \\nPure\\xa0income ‑linked bonds are related to GDP \\ngrowth (e.g. the bonds issued by Argentina some \\nyears ago), while similar bonds – contingent bonds  \\n– can be related to export levels, commodity \\nprices or the occurrence of natural disasters, \\namong others ( Figure 33 B).70\\nGovernments can also increase their tax \\nrevenue linking these with other development \\noutcomes. ap One of the most interesting \\nexamples for enhancing health and nutrition \\nis health taxes. These are excise taxes levied on \\nproducts of high energy density and minimal \\nnutritional value, such as sugar ‑sweetened \\nbeverages (SSBs) ( Pathways\\xa04 and 5).

As such, the food and beverage \\nindustry presents arguments similar to those used by the tobacco \\nindustry to prevent or delay implementation of taxes. Globally, \\nstakeholders with vested interests often use lobbying tactics to sway \\ndecision-makers away from implementing such taxes, or to structure \\ntaxes in such a way as to minimize their negative impact on profits and \\nconsumer purchasing.

While revenues obtained \\nthrough health taxes tend to represent only a \\nsmall fraction of GDP , the revenue increases \\nfrom taxes can be significant, particularly when \\ntaxes across a range of harmful products are \\ncombined. In addition, health tax revenues tend \\nto account for a significant share of public health \\nexpenditure, ranging from 15\\xa0percent in HICs \\nto over 30\\xa0percent in LMICs. 76 A recent World \\nBank analysis found that the largest financing \\ngap for universal health coverage in LMICs could \\nbe largely mitigated by tax increases on SSBs, \\ntobacco and alcohol. 77 By releasing additional \\nresources to be spent on food or improving food \\nenvironments, such taxes can indirectly help \\nreduce undernourishment and food insecurity. \\nSome countries have opted to earmark part \\nor all of revenues generated from health taxes \\ntowards health promotion ( Pathway\\xa05).

Some also argue that, although \\nearmarking funds for health can diversify sources \\nof public health funding, this does not necessarily \\nlead to an increase in overall revenue for public \\nhealth. This is because budgets are fungible, \\nmeaning that earmarked revenue from one source \\nis likely to be offset by reductions in contributions \\nfrom other sources of financing. An alternative \\nis to implement a soft earmark, aligning more \\nclosely with the standard budgeting process. With \\nthis approach, the recommended earmark remains \\nflexible – because no set amount is prescribed \\nfor the earmark, or the expenditure benefiting \\nfrom the earmark is quite broad, or the duration \\nis limited. By highlighting a political priority, \\nsoft earmarking can enhance the visibility and \\npolitical acceptability of a health tax. 76, 78, 79  \\nAs indicated in Section\\xa05.1 , countries with \\nlimited ability to access financing urgently need \\nto de ‑risk financing flows, and this is possible \\nthrough concessional finance. Nevertheless, \\neven if countries with moderate ability to access \\nfinancing have better chances of leveraging \\nprivate financing flows, these flows still need \\nto be de ‑risked.

On such loans, borrowing \\ncountries pay a market ‑based rate that allows \\nIFAD to pay a commensurate coupon to the \\ninvestors. The first two private placements were \\nbought by Folksam, a Swedish insurance and \\npension fund, for USD 100 million, and Dai ‑ichi \\nFrontier Life, a provider of savings ‑type life and \\npension insurance, for USD 50 million. 98\\nResult s-based funding (RBF)  consists of financial \\ninstruments linked to the achievement of certain \\nresults ( Figure 33 C). For example, impact bonds are \\noutcome ‑based instruments that provide capital \\nto an activity with specific and measurable \\noutcomes. The repayment to the investor is \\nlinked to the achievement of these outcomes; \\nin most cases, failure to reach the outcomes \\nleads to a loss, while in some cases, the bond \\nis designed to provide an additional payment \\nwhen outcomes are reached. 99–101  On\\xa0the other \\nhand, impact-linked finance describes all \\nprivate financial activities that are linked with \\nrewards for achieving positive social outcomes. \\nThese instruments have been used in both the \\nhealth and the agrifood systems sector. For \\nexample, through the Global Partnership for \\nResults ‑Based Approach project in Ghana, an \\nRBF grant was used to stimulate demand for \\nurban household sanitation, attracting larger \\ncontractors to supply toilets to low ‑income \\ncommunities as well as financial institutions to \\nenter the market. 102 From an agrifood systems \\nperspective, a project has been financed by \\nthe Impact‑Linked Fund for Eastern and \\nSouthern Africa via an impact ‑linked loan to \\nencourage the company to engage with more \\nwomen farmers throughout the value chain, \\nand as such, lower the interest rate of the loan \\n(Pathway\\xa06).36 Another example is Aceli Africa, a \\nmarket incentive facility that offers results ‑based \\nfinancial incentives to domestic lenders in \\nKenya, Rwanda, Uganda and the United \\nRepublic of Tanzania.

For example, the \\nAsian Development Bank issued 14\\xa0gender bonds \\n(for a total of USD\\xa03.6\\xa0billion) up to 2023 through \\nits gender thematic bond programme, which \\nmobilizes financing towards projects aimed at \\nnarrowing gender disparities and promoting the \\nempowerment of women and girls. 112 In Morocco, \\na private bank (Banque Centrale Populaire) \\nissued a bond of USD 20.4 million to finance \\nwomen‑led projects through microleasing, \\na\\xa0sound alternative for increasing women’s \\naccess to financial services 113 (see Box 14). \\nIndigenous Peoples  face limited access to financial \\nservices not only in LICs and MICs but also in \\nHICs like Australia and Canada. Indigenous \\nPeoples often live in remote rural areas and \\npossess no or little collateral, leading financial \\ninstitutions to perceive that the challenges of \\nproviding services to these communities may \\noutweigh the benefits. 115–117\\nDespite the wide recognition that Indigenous \\nPeoples are indispensable partners for reaching \\nthe targets of the Paris Agreement, the Global \\nBiodiversity Framework and the 2030 Agenda \\nfor Sustainable Development, the corresponding \\nfunding strategies do not necessarily reflect \\ntheir crucial role.

For example, \\ngroup-based approaches can enable asset-poor women \\nto use social collateral instead of physical collateral for \\naccessing credit. Commonly adopted by microfinance \\ninstitutions, this approach allows women to use a \\ngroup’s joint liability as collateral for accessing credit. \\nNevertheless, one of the limitations of this approach \\nis that it usually provides short-term credits that \\ndo not allow women beneficiaries to make major \\ninvestments. 110, 114\\nSome countries have promoted the use of \\nmovable\\xa0collateral such as jewellery or livestock units, \\nin opposition to the usual request for fixed assets. \\nFor example, the establishment of public movable \\ncollateral registries can reduce the risks of using \\nmovable goods as collateral. For agricultural producers, \\nwarehouse receipt finance is an approach where the \\nstored production is used as collateral for accessing \\ncredit and can be sold later when prices are more \\nconvenient. 114\\nMicroleasing is another promising approach in which \\ncollateral is not required since the microfinancing \\ninstitution retains full ownership of the asset until the \\npayment is completed, giving women the opportunity \\nto purchase capital goods and, therefore, access \\nother sources of financing. A microleasing approach \\ncan be more convenient than microcredit for women; \\nfor\\xa0instance, since microleasing is linked to a specific \\ncapital good, women can trust that it will not be \\nexpropriated or used by other household members for \\nnon-business-related expenditures. 114 \\nMobile money has had a positive impact on \\nwomen’s financial inclusion, changing their financial \\nbehaviour and increasing their engagement in savings \\nand budget planning, contributing to their economic \\nempowerment. 60 \\nHowever, these measures should be implemented \\njointly with initiatives for tackling inequalities and \\ngender norms that prevent women from participating \\nin economic activities. This implies addressing the \\nstructural barriers to women’s empowerment and \\ngender equality, by giving equal access to productive \\nresources, services, local institutions and decent \\nemployment, supporting their engagement in planning \\nand decision-making, and strengthening technical \\nskills and financial literacy.

In addition, there is a \\ncrucial need for donors to align their spending \\npriorities with countries’ priorities: Since the \\ncurrent architecture is extremely dominated \\nby HICs and large development agencies, the \\npriorities of recipient countries and communities \\nare not always considered. 34\\nAn important challenge faced by many recipient \\ncountries of ODA, other official flows (OOF) \\nand other development finance flows is their \\nrelatively minor role regarding how development \\nfinance is planned and implemented. az In fact, \\ndiscussions about how to shape financing \\narchitecture have revealed differences between \\nthe vision of some HICs, which have traditionally \\nled the development finance discussion, and \\nthat of some LICs and MICs. For instance, an \\nanalysis of the positions in the 2015 Conference \\non Financing for Development in Addis Ababa \\nfound that, while certain HICs have promoted \\na greater role for the private sector and a vision \\nof national governments as “enablers” for \\nmobilizing private financing flows, some LICs \\nand MICs have argued in favour of enhancing the \\nrole of governments to make sovereign decisions \\nabout their development strategies. ba, 152  The \\nmismatches about how to build solutions could \\naffect the necessary coordination and integration \\nof actors towards a less fragmented financing \\naz These differences are not only noticed between countries but also \\nwithin countries, as there are also important imbalances in the \\nrepresentation of certain population groups.

The term “food security \\nbc As indicated for the EU Taxonomy for environmentally sustainable \\ninvestments in the previous section. \\nbd Ethiopian districts, equivalent to the third level of administrative \\ndivisions in the country. \\nbe USD 1 = EBR 57.165.164\\nand nutrition” has been used to emphasize the \\nachievement of the four dimensions of food \\nsecurity and its tight link with the achievement \\nof nutrition security, as well as the need to \\nadopt complementary actions to achieve food \\nsecurity and nutrition. 166  Nevertheless, it may \\nbe time to recognize the overall objective of \\nachieving “food and nutrition security” as a \\nsingle indivisible policy goal encompassing \\nalso the realization of the right to adequate \\nfood. Certainly, the stagnating trends in the \\nreduction of hunger and food insecurity, and \\nthe slow pace of progress towards the global \\nnutrition targets, including the increasing \\nprevalence of adult obesity in the world, bf \\nare\\xa0sound arguments to make this call, and can \\nstrongly support a better understanding of the \\nimportance of meeting SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 \\nfor all financial stakeholders.\\nThe increased political commitment to \\nmeeting SDG Targets\\xa02.1 and\\xa02.2 should be \\nfollowed, from the perspective of donors, \\nby the creation of a closer nexus between \\nhumanitarian, climate and development \\nfinance. For instance, agencies dealing with \\nhumanitarian issues are in most cases totally \\ndifferent from those managing development \\nactivities, with different sources of financing \\nand time horizons; the same distinction can \\nbe made between national and subnational \\ngovernments. Long ‑term investments should \\nfoster sustainable development in food crisis \\ncontexts to enable humanitarian assistance \\nto meet immediate needs without being \\noverwhelmed by prolonged emergencies. This \\napproach should ensure proper coordination \\nbetween humanitarian and development \\nfinance, with investments oriented towards \\naddressing the root causes of acute and chronic \\nfood insecurity. In countries with ongoing \\ncrises and frequent famine risks, where \\nhumanitarian aid dominates and development \\nfinance is limited, greater coherence is crucial \\nto build resilience to the major drivers of food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition. 167\\nIn addition, climate financing actors have barely \\nconsidered agrifood systems as a priority; \\nbetween 2021 and 2022, less than 4 percent of \\nbf See Chapter 2 .\\n| 136 |'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 168, 'page_label': '137'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\nclimate financing went to agriculture, forestry \\nand other land ‑use activities. 34 However, another \\nstudy showed that, even if climate financing for \\nagrifood systems is decreasing, the share focused \\non food security was slightly increasing until \\n2021.168  Regarding nutrition, on the other hand, \\na recent report shows that climate and nutrition \\nare often not well connected, but that there are \\nmany exceptions revealing, in turn, solid linkages \\nbetween climate and nutrition, which can be \\nstreamlined for better coordination and improved \\nresults. 1 Both situations create opportunities for \\nstrengthening climate–food security–nutrition \\nlinkages and reinforcing agreements that are \\ncurrently in place. For\\xa0example, in 2017 , at COP23, \\ncountries established the Koronivia Joint Work \\non Agriculture, recognizing the important role of \\nagriculture in tackling climate change. In 2022, \\nat\\xa0COP27 , countries agreed on a four ‑year window \\n(2022–2026) for bringing together the discussions \\nabout the linkages between climate, agriculture \\nand food security – the Sharm el ‑Sheikh joint \\nwork on implementation of climate action on \\nagriculture and food security – that makes an \\nexplicit call to move from technical discussions \\nto implementation. 169, 170  During\\xa0COP27 , the \\nEgyptian Presidency launched, in partnership \\nwith WHO, FAO, the Global Alliance for \\nImproved Nutrition, the Scaling Up Nutrition \\nMovement and the UN ‑Nutrition Secretariat, \\nthe Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition, \\na\\xa0multistakeholder, multisectoral global flagship \\nthat focuses on fostering collaboration to \\naccelerate transformative action to address the \\ncritical climate–nutrition nexus. 171\\nTo consolidate the vision of embedding food \\nsecurity and nutrition across sectors and \\nfinancial stakeholders, a new governance of \\nfinance to promote the alignment of financing \\nflows towards collective agrifood systems \\npriorities, such as meeting SDG Targets\\xa02.1 \\nand\\xa02.2, will be imperative. 172 Building this \\nnew governance would require recognition \\nof the role that all food security and nutrition \\nfinancial ecosystem stakeholders have played \\nin building the current fragmentation, and \\nconsideration of stronger incentives to avoid it. \\nNevertheless, it should be noted that for at least \\ntwo decades the issue of fragmentation has been \\npart of the agenda in high ‑level political fora. \\nFor example, the Monterrey Consensus in 2002 bg \\nemphasized the need for donors, countries and \\ninternational development agencies to increase \\ntheir efforts to harmonize their procedures \\nat country level, taking national needs and \\nobjectives into account. Even if theoretically the \\nprinciples of coordination are well articulated, \\nputting them into practice has been challenging, \\nespecially when considering complex areas of \\naction such as food security and nutrition, and \\nagrifood systems transformation. 173 Stronger \\nmultistakeholder leadership at the international \\nlevel will be key for making food security and \\nnutrition financing coordination work. \\nOne essential step for effective coordination \\nis placing national and local actors and their \\npriorities in the “driver’s seat”. However, this \\nis not always straightforward, considering, \\namong other challenges, the imbalance of \\npower and capabilities among actors, the \\nlack of donor coordination at the global level \\nthat negatively affects coordination efforts \\nat the national level, and the data gap that \\nmight make it difficult to build the case for \\nshifting donors’ priorities. 173 Nevertheless, \\nthere are ongoing efforts to address these \\nissues. For\\xa0example, the G20 has supported \\nthe creation of country ‑level coordination \\nbodies for specific development goals (e.g. the \\nDevelopment Partners Coordination Group in \\nRwanda). 35 The experience of joint programme \\nfunding at the regional level (e.g. the Alliance \\nfor a Green Revolution in Africa) or at the \\nglobal level (e.g. the Global Agriculture and \\nFood Security Program and the Global Donor \\nPlatform for Rural Development) provides \\ninteresting examples of pooling resources \\nfrom different sources towards country ‑level \\npriorities. 173 Therefore, a requisite for successful \\ncoordination is the integration of food security \\nand nutrition financing flows, even if coming \\nfrom different stakeholders with divergent \\ninterests, into the objectives defined by the most \\nlegitimate bodies at the regional, national and \\nsubnational levels. 142 \\nbg The Monterrey Consensus was the outcome of the 2002 Monterrey \\nConference, the United Nations International Conference on Financing \\nfor Development in Monterrey, Mexico.

One important example \\nof coordination mechanisms is the One Health \\napproach, an integrated, unifying approach \\nto balance and optimize the health of people, \\nanimals and ecosystems. This approach \\nrecognizes that the health of humans, animals, \\nplants and the wider environment are closely \\ninterlinked and offers a means to tackle associated \\nthreats to the human–animal–plant–environment \\ninterface through collaboration and coordination \\nbetween all relevant sectors and stakeholders \\ninvolved. 174 This approach makes it possible to \\nharness and integrate expertise and resources \\nfrom across the spectrum of health domains and \\nother disciplines, and it is a proven approach \\nto policymaking and cross ‑sector collaboration \\nto prevent zoonotic and vector ‑borne diseases \\nfrom emerging and re ‑emerging, ensuring \\nfood safety and maintaining sustainable food \\nproduction; reducing antimicrobial ‑resistant \\ninfections; and addressing environmental \\nissues to collectively improve human, animal \\nand environmental health, among many other \\nareas. In addition to saving lives and promoting \\nwell‑being, One\\xa0Health actions offer important \\neconomic benefits. FAO and the World Bank \\nestimate that One Health efforts could bring at \\nleast USD\\xa037 billion per year back to the global \\ncommunity, while investing in One Health \\nrequires less than 10 percent of this figure. \\nAs\\xa0countries consider investing in health security \\nand other targets (e.g. agricultural production \\nand food security, and healthy ecosystems), \\nOne\\xa0Health can be a particularly relevant \\nconcept for country budget allocation among \\nthe ministries responsible for security as well as \\nhuman, animal and environmental health (e.g. in \\ndecisions by the finance minister, parliamentary \\nbody, or prime minister). 175 \\nBesides enhancing coordination, financial \\nstakeholders should take steps towards \\nimproving their role in scaling up financing \\nfor food security and nutrition. As noted \\nthroughout this document, food security and \\nnutrition is considered a risky investment for \\nprivate commercial actors. As a consequence, \\ndevelopment partners such as donors, including \\nIFIs, MDBs and DFIs, should take the lead in \\nde‑risking activities, for instance, increasing \\nthe allocation of ODA oriented to mobilizing \\nprivate investments, through blended finance or \\nother financing instruments. 35, 81  Considering, \\non the one hand, that countries with limited \\nability to access financing rely mostly on \\nconcessional finance and, on the other hand, that \\nthese financing flows are insufficient to cover \\nthe financing gap for meeting SDG\\xa0Targets\\xa02.1 \\nand\\xa02.2, the shift of ODA flows for mobilizing \\nprivate finance could be an effective solution for \\nscaling up financing in these countries, which are \\noften affected by one or multiple drivers of food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition. Official development \\nassistance can be strategically implemented in \\nUMICs to incentivize the gradual increase in \\ndomestic funding by governments, as well as \\nthe transition towards more commerce ‑oriented \\nloans, with the objective of targeting grants and \\nconcessional financing to LICs and LMICs. 35\\nMultilateral development banks face the \\nchallenge of increasing risk tolerance towards \\nfood security and nutrition investments and \\nneed to put in perspective their contribution \\nto achieving overall development objectives. \\nRecent\\xa0research found that MDBs’ credit rating \\nagencies were overestimating financial risk, \\nwhich made these institutions more conservative \\nregarding expenditures in high‑risk markets. 34 \\nIn fact, DFIs\\xa0are governed by prudential rules \\nand statutes, which prevent them from lending \\nto high ‑risk projects.

Unfortunately, current arrangements for \\nrestructuring sovereign debt are complex and \\ntime ‑consuming, and often result in non‑optimal \\noutcomes for borrower countries. In addition, \\ndebtors are usually placed in a very vulnerable \\nsituation before their creditors. 180  There have \\nbeen past and current initiatives to address this \\nissue, such as the IMF’s Heavily Indebted Poor \\nCountries Initiative, 181 the former G20–World \\nBank–IMF Debt Service Suspension Initiative \\n(DSSI) 182  and the G20 Common Framework for \\nDebt Treatments beyond the DSSI, launched in \\n2020.183  However, especially after the COVID ‑19 \\npandemic, the needs for countries to alleviate \\ntheir debt are increasing, and policy responses \\nhave been inadequate. bi Higher ‑income countries, \\nespecially the members of major political fora \\nsuch as the G7 or the G20, should take, jointly \\nwith MDBs, a stronger position on debt relief, \\nmaking the current mechanisms work and \\nsupporting coordination with private creditors to \\nfacilitate negotiations with debtor countries. 7 \\nThe IMF has itself begun to explore how \\nenvironmental and social factors can be as critical \\nas economic and financial factors for assessing \\nsovereign debt sustainability.

For instance, some scholars \\nhave flagged that the increased financialization of \\nagrifood systems could lead to negative outcomes \\nsuch as land grabbing, food price volatility and \\ncorporate concentration. 186  As previously outlined \\nin Box 10 (Chapter\\xa04), concerns have also been \\nraised vis ‑à‑vis the negative impacts that private \\nsector investments may have with regard to food \\nsecurity and nutrition outcomes. Private actors \\nmust incorporate health, environmental and \\nsocial risks into their financial decision ‑making, \\nto shift financing flows from potentially harmful \\ninvestments to others that work towards the \\nachievement of environmental, health and social \\noutcomes. Currently, most financial stakeholders \\ndo not account for the hidden costs of agrifood \\nsystems in their business models, and they do \\nnot have standardized reporting measures for \\nclimate, biodiversity and health. 141 Evidently, \\nthere is a need to realign incentives with \\nsustainability, and these incentives are heavily \\nshaped by public support, which, as noted in \\nChapter\\xa04, must be repurposed.\\nTo this end, incentives for capital markets \\nshould align within environmental, social and \\ngovernance investing practices, and food security \\nand nutrition must be explicitly embedded in \\nthere. 34, 187  For instance, from 2012 to 2020, the \\nvalue of ESG assets tripled to USD 40.5 trillion \\n(i.e. almost half of all assets under management). \\nDisclosure regulations and standards can be \\nestablished, entreating private financial actors \\nto disclose how their investment portfolios may \\naffect food security and nutrition outcomes. \\nTechnical standards are already in place, such \\nas the European Union Sustainable Finance \\nDisclosures Regulation or Japan’s Corporate \\nGovernance Code, each designed to disclose the \\nalignment of investors with sustainability and/or \\nclimate standards. 100 \\nAt the global level, in 2020, the Access to Nutrition \\nInitiative released the Investor Expectations \\non Nutrition, Diets and Health, which to date \\nhave been signed by 87\\xa0institutional investors. \\nThe document commits these investors to \\nengaging with food and beverage manufacturers \\nto address most of the challenges considered \\nin SDG\\xa0Target\\xa02.2 and the World Health \\nAssembly targets (undernutrition, overweight \\nand obesity, micronutrient deficiencies and \\ndiet‑related non ‑communicable diseases) in \\nparticular, promoting a more active role for \\nprivate companies in delivering healthy diets \\nfor all. 188, 189  Other financing instruments often \\nadopted by private actors, such as venture capital \\nin technological investments, are increasing; \\nnevertheless, only 10\\xa0percent of venture capital \\nallocation in 2021 was directed to agrifood \\ntechnology. The food security and nutrition \\nconsiderations of these portfolios remain low \\nand extremely concentrated in HICs; however, \\nthere is growing interest in agricultural practices \\nthat conserve more soil and water and increase \\nnutritional density in foods. 156  For example, the \\nventure capital company Tikehau launched an \\nEUR 1 billion regenerative agriculture fund, \\nsupported by several large food and insurance \\nfirms. The fund has tied 50 percent of “carried \\ninterest” to impact ‑linked finance (see\\xa0Section\\xa05.2 ) \\nand expects to leverage a minimum of USD\\xa07 \\nin terms of profitability and social and \\nenvironmental benefits from every USD\\xa01 \\ninvested in regenerative agriculture. 156\\nPublic–private partnerships (PPPs) offer \\nopportunities to mobilize and leverage \\ngreater resources, expertise and innovation to \\nagricultural and rural development projects. \\nUnlike blended finance, PPPs work along \\nthe whole investment cycle; for instance, \\nby\\xa0partnering with local banks and aggregators, \\nIFIs can leverage their financial capabilities \\nto reach more small ‑scale producers and \\nrural communities in need.

While humanitarian \\nassistance is crucial for immediate relief, coordinated \\nefforts are needed to address the root causes of food \\ncrises and reduce reliance on humanitarian aid. 167\\nMapping the agrifood finance landscape for \\nnutrition is also critical. An example of this is the \\nScaling Up Nutrition methodology for identifying \\nand analysing nutrition-sensitive investments in \\nagriculture and food systems; a guidance note \\ndetailing this method was published by FAO in \\n2020.199 The method was adapted and implemented \\nin ten countries.

While PPPs \\ncan offer opportunities for innovation, careful \\nmanagement and oversight are necessary to \\nmitigate potential harm and ensure that public \\nhealth objectives remain the primary focus in \\nnutrition financing initiatives. Public–private \\npartnerships most commonly fail due to a lack of \\nstrong governance and regulatory frameworks. 191 \\nIn response, it is vital that governments and \\nother key stakeholders including United \\nNations Agencies, academia and civil society \\nadopt a clear framework to avoid conflicts of \\ninterest and ensure impartiality, accountability \\nand transparency in policymaking and food \\nand nutrition financing. 175 There are several \\nexamples of such frameworks that can be \\nused and replicated. The UNICEF guidance \\non engagement with the food and beverage \\nindustry 192  summarizes ten parameters to guide \\nactions across all UNICEF programme areas \\nincluding principles on avoiding engagement \\nwith companies that interfere with public policies \\nor produce highly processed foods. 193  The WHO \\nreport on safeguarding against possible conflicts \\nof interest in nutrition programmes 194  aligns \\nwith its internal framework of engagement with \\nnon‑state actors 195  and lays out six steps, each \\nfollowed by an assessment to support national \\nauthorities in deciding whether engagement \\nwith the external actor should continue or \\nbe terminated. It includes guidance on risk \\nmanagement with respect to engaging with \\nexternal actors and emphasizes the importance \\nof monitoring and evaluation, accountability and \\ntransparency. 194\\nNevertheless, the public sector plays an \\nessential role in filling the gaps not addressed \\nby commercially oriented actors, primarily by \\ninvesting in public goods and enhancing social \\nvalues. 196  National and subnational governments \\n(the latter in the case of federal countries) can \\nfurther mobilize domestic tax revenues, increase \\npriority sector expenditures on food security \\nand nutrition and consider repurposing policy \\nsupport (see Chapter\\xa04 ). As analysed in Section\\xa05.1 , \\ncountries with limited ability to access financing \\ndo not have enough fiscal space to increase \\ntax revenues, mostly due to structural and \\ngovernance issues. At the same time, while these \\ncountries strengthen governance and institutions \\n(essential for accessing more financing options), \\nattention should turn to bringing down \\ncorruption in tax collection and management and \\nreducing tax evasion. In parallel, countries that \\nalready have a higher ability to access financing \\nmust enact stronger controls on tax havens and \\nmoney laundering, which often allow tax evasion \\nfrom countries with limited access to financing. 34 \\nOne interesting development is that, since \\nthe 1980s, corporate income tax (CIT) has \\ndecreased globally, starting a sort of “race” \\namong countries to attract investments through \\nlower taxes. 197, 198  High‑income countries bj \\nhave on average lower CIT rates than LICs and \\nMICs197 and lower financial risk; therefore, most \\nof the multinational corporations operating \\naround the world establish their tax residency \\nin HICs rather than in LICs and MICs.

While this step is very \\nimportant, the report has also starkly shown \\nthat the current structure and availability of \\nfinancial data impede the application of the \\nnewly proposed definition to the public and \\nprivate financing flows globally available for \\nfood security and nutrition. In other words, \\ndue\\xa0to serious data constraints, it is not possible \\nto arrive at the global measurement of the \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition that \\nis currently available and of the financing gap \\nthat must be bridged to support efforts towards \\nmeeting SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2.\\nAt best, it is possible to know that not even \\none-quarter of all international development \\nfunding flows go to food security and nutrition, \\nand this share is not growing.

However, relatively \\nfewer flows go to addressing the major drivers \\nof food insecurity and malnutrition, namely \\nconflict, climate variability and extremes, and \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns, and their \\nunderlying structural factors, lack of access \\nto and unaffordability of nutritious foods, \\nunhealthy food environments, and high and \\npersistent inequality. \\nAssessing public domestic financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition is problematic as there \\nis no global financial database with sufficient \\ndata for the analysis. Public spending on \\nagriculture is available globally, but this \\naccounts for only a fraction, and sometimes \\na very small one, of all the public spending \\non food security and nutrition. There are not \\nreadily available data for all the countries in \\nthe world to estimate the public spending that \\nis supporting food security and nutrition. \\nAn analysis of ten low- and middle-income \\ncountries shows that public spending on food \\nsecurity and nutrition was growing before \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, with support to food \\nconsumption taking the greatest share, but this \\ntrend could not be sustained in some countries. \\nGovernments in some middle-income countries \\nalso seem to be spending relatively larger \\nshares of their budget on addressing the major \\nhigher in poor countries affected by more \\nthan one major driver. Because agrifood \\nsystems in these countries are not resilient to \\nthese external forces, hunger, food insecurity \\nand malnutrition are still on the rise and \\ndisproportionately affect children. Moreover, \\nunderlying structural factors such as lack of \\naccess to and unaffordability of nutritious \\nfoods, unhealthy food environments, and high \\nand persistent inequality further worsen the \\nnegative effects of the external drivers on food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nBusiness as usual is not an option in the face \\nof the major drivers of food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition, and their growing occurrence \\nand intensity. Past editions of this report have \\nclearly laid out what must be done. Different \\npolicies, interventions and investments as well \\nas legislation changes are proven to work in \\ndiverse contexts and in different combinations; \\nhowever, there seems to be a binding financing \\nconstraint to implement them at scale and with \\nbetter targeting. Paradoxically , pinpointing \\nthe financing gap to support efforts towards \\nmeeting SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 is a daunting \\ntask since there is no coherent picture of the \\nfinancing flows available for, and being spent \\non, food security and nutrition. \\nA serious problem is the lack of a common \\ndefinition or standard for measuring financing \\nfor food security and nutrition. It is hard – \\nif\\xa0not impossible – to manage what cannot be \\nadequately measured.

Philanthropic \\nflows to food security and nutrition are not \\nlarge; cross-border remittances are much \\nlarger, but they support food security and \\nnutrition mostly through food consumption \\nrather than investments in agrifood systems. \\nAmong\\xa0international commercial private \\nfinancing flows, foreign direct investment is \\nthe flow type with the most comprehensive \\ndata source. However, there cannot be a full \\naccounting of private financing, since, as this \\nreport has shown, comprehensive and relevant \\nnumbers on market finance (i.e. issuance of \\nstocks and corporate bonds), international \\nbank loans and domestic private equity are \\nextremely difficult to obtain. Furthermore, \\nwhere there is access to these sources of private \\nfinancing, their contribution to food security \\nand nutrition cannot be taken for granted, \\nas many of the investments being financed – \\nparticularly those by large international food \\nand beverage companies – may not always \\nhelp reduce hunger, food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition. The main source of funding for \\ncompanies in sectors relevant to food security \\nand nutrition, at least for farmers and small and \\nmedium enterprises, appears to be self -funding, \\non\\xa0which no data exist.\\nAgainst such a backdrop, this report lays bare \\nthe dismal state of the availability, accessibility \\nand adequacy of financing flows data that \\nwould allow a proper assessment of financing \\nfor food security and nutrition. Addressing \\nthis gap must be a top priority, and this report \\nsends a strong and urgent call for global and \\nnational actions to address this problem as part \\nof the SDG global agenda for action. This\\xa0call \\nfalls squarely within the purview of SDG\\xa017 \\n– Strengthen the means of implementation \\nand revitalize the Global Partnership for \\nSustainable Development. Finance and \\nfinancial inclusion are among the key means \\nof implementation in SDG 17 , therefore this \\nreport’s call to address the financing data \\ngap must be prioritized as a key action to be \\ntaken immediately. \\nOf course, beyond the data gap there is an \\nimportant financing gap to bridge. While this \\nreport has demonstrated that it is not possible \\nto fully apply the newly proposed definition of \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition to all \\nrelevant financing flows available due to data \\nconstraints, existing model -based scenarios \\nsuggest that different policies and interventions \\nto reach SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 bear a cost in \\nthe trillions of USD. No matter the estimate, \\nmore financing for food security and nutrition \\nis needed, particularly in countries with the \\ngreatest needs. Moreover, there needs to be a \\nserious rethinking of how existing financing \\nis being allocated because in several instances \\nthe current financing is not cost effective, \\nand this is resulting in lost opportunities to \\nreduce hunger, food insecurity and all forms \\nof malnutrition much faster. There are also \\ninequalities in the access to financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition both between countries \\nand within countries. Such inequalities are \\nfurther exacerbated within countries by a lack \\nof inclusive and gender-sensitive financing. \\nCountries that have the greatest need for \\nfinancing are those that struggle the most to \\nactually access financing. Around 63 percent \\nof the countries with high and/or increasing \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition \\nstruggle to access financing for food security \\nand nutrition and have limited or moderate \\nability to access financing. Most of these \\ncountries (82 percent) are affected by one or \\nmore of the major drivers of food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. This is quite at odds with the \\nfact that very few of the international official \\ndevelopment flows going to these countries \\nare directed towards addressing these drivers. \\nScaling up financing towards countries with the \\nhighest levels of hunger, food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition and those most affected by the \\nmajor drivers is essential.\\nCountries facing limited ability to access \\nfinancing also have high levels of sovereign \\ndebt and must spend important amounts of \\npublic revenues on servicing debt.

Donors, MDBs, \\nDFIs, IFIs and philanthropic foundations have \\nincreased in number, but this has created \\nfurther coordination challenges, both\\xa0among \\nactors and with recipient countries, whose \\npolitical and financial priorities are not \\nalways considered. Therefore, more can be \\nachieved in scaling up financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition if there is better \\nalignment and synergy among the different \\nsources of financing.\\nEnding hunger, food insecurity and all forms \\nof malnutrition is also unnecessarily in \\ncompetition with many other development \\nobjectives. Considering the complex and \\nmultisectoral nature of food security and \\nnutrition, the financial landscape must shift \\nfrom a siloed approach towards a more holistic \\nperspective, in which financial stakeholders \\ncan streamline food security and nutrition \\nobjectives into broader financing flows and \\ninvestments. A starting point is breaking the \\nsectoral silos within food security and nutrition, \\nfrom complementary but separate “food \\nsecurity” and “nutrition” objectives towards a \\nsingle “food and nutrition security” policy goal. \\nEmbracing this new narrative can be catalytic \\nin recognizing the interconnected dependency \\nof both – one without the other prevents the \\nachievement of either. A new narrative for \\nfinancing for food security and nutrition \\nacross sectors and financial stakeholders can \\nhelp lead to a new finance governance that \\npromotes the complementarity of the different \\nfinancing flows towards food security and \\nnutrition. For example, a closer nexus between \\nhumanitarian, climate and development finance \\nmust be promoted, as these are essential for \\nmeeting SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2.

Country-level results are presented only for those \\ncountries for which estimates are based on official \\nnational data (see note b) or as provisional \\nestimates, based on FAO data collected through the \\nGallup © World Poll for countries whose national \\nrelevant authorities expressed no objection to their \\npublication. Note that consent to publication does \\nnot necessarily imply validation of the estimate by \\nthe national authorities involved and that the \\nestimate is subject to revision as soon as suitable \\ndata from official national sources are available. \\nGlobal, regional and subregional aggregates are \\nbased on data collected in approximately \\n150\\xa0countries.\\n4. The estimates referring to the middle of the \\nprojected ranges for the years 2020 to 2022 were \\nused to calculate the three-year averages.\\n5.

Model selection is \\nbased on best fit.\\na. Consecutive low population coverage; \\ninterpret\\xa0with caution.\\nb. Based on official national data.\\nc. For years when official national data are not \\navailable, the estimates are integrated with FAO \\ndata. See Annex 1B  for further details.\\nd. Results based on data collected by FAO through \\nthe Gallup © World Poll (see Annex 1B  for \\nmethodology) are provisional and will be revised \\nsoon, as the National Institute of Statistics and \\nInformatics (INEI) has made great progress in \\nadapting and incorporating the Food Insecurity \\nExperience Scale module in the National Household \\nSurvey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares – ENAHO).\\ne. Most recent input data are from before 2000; \\ninterpret with caution.\\nf. The UNICEF–WHO low birthweight estimates are \\nderived through standard methodology applied to all \\ncountries to ensure comparability and are not the \\nofficial statistics of the Government of India. India’s \\nmost recent national official low birthweight \\nprevalence is 18.2 percent from the 2019–2021 \\nNational Family Health Survey–5 (NFHS-5), which is \\nused as the basis of the UNICEF–WHO global \\nestimation model to support cross-country \\ncomparability.\\ng. This estimate has been adjusted because the \\noriginal estimate did not cover the full age range \\nor\\xa0the data source was only representative of \\nrural\\xa0areas.\\nh.

National estimates are \\nreported as three-year moving averages, to \\ncontrol for the low reliability of the estimates \\nof some of the underlying parameters due to \\nelements for which complete, reliable information \\nis very scarce. This includes, for example, the \\nyear-to-year variation in food commodity stocks, \\none of the components of the annual FAO Food \\nBalance Sheets (FBS). Regional and global \\naggregates, on the other hand, are reported as \\nannual estimates, as possible estimation errors \\nare expected not to be correlated and therefore \\nexpected to be reduced to acceptable levels when \\naggregating across countries. \\nThe entire series of PoU values is revised with \\neach new edition of this report to reflect new \\ndata and information that FAO has obtained \\nsince the release of the previous edition. As this \\nprocess usually implies backward revisions of \\nthe entire PoU series, readers are advised to \\nrefrain from comparing series across different \\neditions of this report and should always refer \\nto the current edition of the report, including for \\nvalues in past years. \\nMethodology:  To compute an estimate of the \\nprevalence of undernourishment in a population, \\nthe probability distribution of habitual dietary \\nenergy intake levels (expressed in kcal per person \\nper day) for the average individual is modelled \\nas a parametric probability density function, \\nf(x).1, 2  The indicator is obtained as the cumulative \\nprobability that the habitual dietary energy \\nintake ( x) is below the minimum dietary energy \\nrequirement (MDER) (i.e. the lowest limit of the \\nrange of energy requirements that is appropriate \\nfor the population’s representative average \\nindividual) as in the formula below:\\nPoU = ∫x<MDER  f(x|θ)dx,\\nwhere θ is a vector of parameters that \\ncharacterizes the probability density function. \\nIn the actual computations, the distribution \\nis assumed to be lognormal and thus fully \\ncharacterized by only two parameters: the mean \\ndietary energy consumption (DEC) and its \\ncoefficient of variation (CV).\\nData source:  Different data sources are used to \\nestimate the different parameters of the model.\\nMinimum dietary energy requirement (MDER):  Human \\nenergy requirements for an individual in a \\ngiven sex/age class are determined on the basis \\nof normative requirements for basic metabolic \\nrate per kilogram of body mass, multiplied by \\nthe ideal weights that a healthy person of that \\nsex/age class may have, given their height, and \\nthen multiplied by a coefficient of physical \\nactivity level (PAL) to take into account physical \\nactivit y.bl Given that both healthy body mass \\nindices (BMIs) and normal PALs vary among \\nactive and healthy individuals of the same sex \\nand age, a range of energy requirements apply \\nto each sex and age group of the population. \\nThe MDER for the average individual in the \\npopulation, which is the parameter used in \\nthe PoU formula, is obtained as the weighted \\naverage of the lower bounds of the energy \\nrequirement ranges for each sex and age group, \\nusing the shares of the population in each sex \\nbl A person is considered healthy if their BMI indicates neither \\nunderweight nor overweight.

Similar to the MDER, \\nthe average dietary energy requirement (ADER) \\n(used to estimate the one component of the \\nCV as described below) is estimated using the \\naverage values of the PAL category “ Active or \\nmoderately active lifestyle”. 4 \\nInformation on the population structure by sex \\nand age needed to compute the MDER is available \\nfor most countries in the world and for each year \\nfrom the United Nations Department of Economic \\nand Social Affairs World Population Prospects , \\nrevised every two years. This edition of The State \\nof Food Security and Nutrition in the World uses the \\n2022 revision of the World Population Prospects .5\\nInformation on the median height in each sex and \\nage group for a given country is derived from a \\nrecent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) or \\nfrom other surveys that collect anthropometry \\ndata on children and adults. Even if such surveys \\ndo not refer to the same year for which the \\nPoU is estimated, the impact of possible small \\nintervening changes in median heights over the \\nyears on the MDER, and therefore on the PoU \\nestimates, is expected to be negligible.\\nDietary energy consumption (DEC):  Ideally, DEC could \\nbe estimated from data on food consumption \\ncoming from nationally representative household \\nsurveys (such as Living Standards Measurement \\nStudy [LSMS] surveys or Household Consumption \\nand Expenditure Surveys). However, only very \\nfew countries conduct such surveys on an annual \\nbasis. Thus, in FAO’s PoU estimates for global \\nmonitoring, DEC values are estimated from the \\ndietary energy supply (DES) reported in the FBS, \\ncompiled by FAO for most countries in the world. 6\\nSince the last edition of this report, the FBS \\ndomain on FAOSTAT has been updated with new \\nvalues of the series up to 2021 for all countries. \\nIn addition, at the time of closing this report, the \\nFBS series were updated to 2022 for the following \\n68 countries, selected as a priority due to the high \\ncontribution they make to the total number of \\nundernourished people in the world: Afghanistan, \\nAngola, Argentina, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia \\n(Plurinational State of), Brazil, Burkina Faso, \\nCameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, \\nColombia, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic \\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic \\nof the Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, \\nGuatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, India, \\nIndonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Japan, \\nJordan, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, \\nMalawi, Malaysia, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, \\nMyanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, \\nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, \\nRwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, \\nSomalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, \\nSudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, \\nTogo, Uganda, Ukraine, United Republic of \\nTanzania, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), \\nViet Nam, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe. \\nIn addition, FBS\\xa0DES series were updated \\nup to 2022 for another group of 27\\xa0countries \\nthat contribute less to the total number of \\nundernourished people: Albania, Armenia, \\nBahamas, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cabo\\xa0Verde, \\nChile, China (mainland), Costa\\xa0Rica, Djibouti, \\nDominican\\xa0Republic, El\\xa0Salvador, Eswatini, \\nJamaica, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, \\nMongolia, Montenegro, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, \\nSao\\xa0Tome and Principe, Slovakia, Timor-Leste, \\nTunisia and United States of America. \\nPer capita average DES in 2022 (for countries \\nother than the ones listed above) and in 2023 \\n(for all countries) are nowcast on the basis of the \\nshort-run market outlook exercises conducted by \\nFAO to inform the World Food Situation Portal 7 \\nand used to calculate the 2022 and 2023 values of \\nDEC for each country.\\nWaste factors\\nThis edition of the report involved updating the \\nwaste factors that are used to calculate the DEC \\nby subtracting the percentage of waste from the \\nDES for all countries. The percentages of food \\nwaste at distribution level have been estimated \\nusing the FBS data available on FAOSTAT. \\nUsing the percentages given in FAO’s document \\nGlobal food losses and food waste ,8 calorie waste for \\neach food group is calculated and summed up, \\nwith the exception that the waste factors used for \\ncereals is 2 percent for all the regions.

Since the last edition \\nof this report, 14 new surveys from the following \\n13 countries have been processed to update \\nthe CV|y: Armenia (2022), Costa Rica (2019), \\nCôte\\xa0d’Ivoire (2022), India (2011/12 and 2022/23), \\nJordan (2017), Kazakhstan (2022), Maldives (2016), \\nMali (2022), Mexico (2022), Niger (2022), Republic \\nof Moldova (2022), Senegal (2022) and Timor-Leste \\n(2015). That makes for a total of 143 surveys from \\n69 countries for which the estimate of the CV|y is \\nbased on data from national surveys. \\nWhen no suitable survey data are available, \\nFood\\xa0Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) data \\ncollected by FAO since 2014 are used to project \\nthe changes in the CV|y from 2015 (or from the \\nyear of the last food consumption survey, if \\nmore recent) up to 2023, based on the observed \\ntrend in severe food insecurity. The projections \\nare based on the assumption that observed \\nchanges in the extent of severe food insecurity \\nmeasured with the FIES might be indicative of \\nequivalent changes in the PoU. To the extent that \\nsuch implied changes in the PoU cannot be fully \\nexplained by the “supply-side” effects of changes \\nin average food supplies, they can be confidently \\nattributed to unobserved changes in the CV|y that \\nmight have occurred at the same time. Analysis of \\nhistorical PoU estimates reveals that, on average, \\nand once differences in DEC, MDER and CV|r \\nhave been controlled for, differences in the CV|y \\nexplain about one-third of the differences in PoU \\nacross time and space. Based on all this, for each \\ncountry for which FIES data are available, the \\nchange in the CV|y that may have occurred from \\n2015, or from the date of the last available survey, \\nis\\xa0therefore estimated as the change that would \\ngenerate one-third of a percentage-point change \\nin the PoU for each observed percentage-point \\nchange in the prevalence of severe food \\ninsecurity. For all other countries, lacking any \\nsupporting evidence, the CV|y is kept constant \\nat the last available estimate.

The severity of food \\ninsecurity is measured using data collected with \\nthe Food Insecurity Experience Scale Survey \\nModule (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions \\nasking respondents to self-report conditions \\nand experiences typically associated with \\nlimited access to food. For purposes of annual \\nSDG monitoring, the questions are asked with \\nreference to the 12\\xa0months preceding the survey.\\nUsing sophisticated statistical techniques based \\non the Rasch model, the information obtained \\nin an FIES-SM survey is validated for internal \\nconsistency and converted into a quantitative \\nmeasure along a scale of severity, ranging from \\nlow to high. Based on their responses to the \\nsurvey items, the individuals or households \\ninterviewed in a nationally representative survey \\nof the population are assigned a probability of \\nbeing in one of three classes: i) food secure or \\nonly marginally insecure; ii) moderately food \\ninsecure; and iii) severely food insecure, as \\ndefined by two globally set thresholds. Based on \\nFIES data collected over three years from 2014 \\nto 2016, FAO has established the FIES reference \\nscale, which is used as the global standard for \\nexperience-based food-insecurity measures, and \\nto set the two reference thresholds of severity.\\nSDG Indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated \\nprobability of being in the two classes of moderate \\nand severe food insecurity. A separate indicator \\n(FIsev) is computed by considering only the severe \\nfood insecurity class.\\nHow it is reported: In this report, FAO provides \\nestimates of food insecurity at two different \\nlevels of severity: moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity (FI mod+sev ), and severe food insecurity \\n(FIsev). For each of these two levels, two \\nestimates are reported:\\n \\x84 the prevalence (percent) of individuals in the \\npopulation living in households where at least \\none adult was found to be food insecure; and'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 233, 'page_label': '202'}, page_content='ANNEX 1B\\n| 202 |\\n \\x84 the estimated number of individuals  in the \\npopulation living in households where at least \\none adult was found to be food insecure.\\nData source:  Since 2014, the eight-question FIES-SM \\nhas been applied in nationally representative \\nsamples of the adult population (defined as aged \\n15\\xa0or older) in more than 140\\xa0countries included \\nin the Gallup © World Poll (GWP), covering \\nmore than 90\\xa0percent of the world population. \\nIn 2023, interviews were conducted in both \\ntelephone and face-to-face modality.

To arrive at \\nthe prevalence and number of individuals (of all \\nages) in the population , an estimate is required \\nof the number of people living in households \\nwhere at least one adult is estimated to be food \\ninsecure. This involves a multistep procedure \\ndetailed in Annex\\xa0II of Methods for estimating \\ncomparable rates of food insecurity experienced \\nby adults throughout the world (see link in the \\n“Recommended readings” section, below). \\nRegional and global aggregates of food insecurity \\nat moderate or severe, and severe levels, FI L,r, \\nare computed as:\\nFIL,r = ∑c FI L,c  × Nc\\n∑c Nc\\nwhere r indicates the region, FI L,c  is the value \\nof FI at level L  estimated for country c in the \\nregion, and Nc is the corresponding population \\nsize. When no estimate of FI L is available for \\na country, it is assumed to be equal to the \\npopulation-weighted average of the estimated \\nvalues of the remaining countries in the same \\nsubregion. A regional aggregate is produced only \\nif the countries for which an estimate is available \\ncover at least 50\\xa0percent of the region’s population.\\nUniversal thresholds are defined on the FIES \\nglobal standard scale (a set of item parameter \\nvalues based on results from all countries covered \\nby the GWP in 2014–2016) and converted into \\ncorresponding values on local scales. The process \\nof calibrating each country’s scale against the FIES \\nglobal standard can be referred to as equating  \\nand permits the production of internationally \\ncomparable measures of food insecurity severity \\nfor individual respondents, as well as comparable \\nnational prevalence rates.\\nThe problem stems from the fact that, when \\ndefined as a latent trait, the severity of food \\ninsecurity has no absolute reference against \\nwhich it could be evaluated. The Rasch model \\nenables identification of the relative position \\nthat the various items occupy on a scale that is \\ndenominated in logit units but whose “zero” \\nis arbitrarily set, usually to correspond to the \\nmean estimated severity. This implies that the \\nzero of the scale changes in each application. \\nTo produce comparable measures over time and \\nacross different populations requires establishing \\na common scale to use as a reference and finding \\nthe formula needed to convert measures across \\ndifferent scales.

For cross-country comparability, \\nthe cost of a healthy diet is converted from local \\ncurrency units (LCU) to international dollars \\nusing purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange \\nrates for private consumption. The CoHD \\nindicator is thus reported as average PPP dollars \\nper person per day .\\nData source:  The prices of items in each food group \\nneeded for a healthy diet are obtained using \\nretail food price data from the International \\nComparison Program (ICP), coordinated by \\nthe World Bank, which estimates PPPs based \\non a range of internationally standardized \\nitems expressed in LCU. 11 For international \\ncomparisons, prices in LCU are converted into \\ninternational dollars using PPP conversion factors \\nfor private consumption computed by the ICP and \\nreported in the World Development Indicators \\n(WDI) database. 12 To\\xa0update the cost of a healthy \\ndiet in gap years where ICP rounds are not \\navailable, food consumer price index (CPI) data \\npublished by FAO are used. 13\\nMethodology:\\nMethod for defining a healthy diet basket\\nGiven that the foods selected for a healthy diet \\nvary by local context, countries have developed \\nnational FBDGs to recommend healthy dietary \\nhabits that reflect their specific cultural context \\nand locally available foods.

The cost per day of each \\nfood group is calculated as the price of acquiring \\nthe selected items in that group multiplied by the \\nquantity containing the energy content required \\nby the HDB for that group.

As the basket is \\ndesigned to include only the cheapest nutritious foods that compose a \\nhealthy diet, this means that using the aggregate food CPI may lead to \\nan overestimation of the cost of a healthy diet.\\nUNAFFORDABILITY OF A HEALTHY DIET\\nDefinition:  The unaffordability of a healthy diet is \\ndefined as the inability of a household or of an \\nindividual to pay the amount of money needed \\nto acquire the least-cost combination of locally \\navailable foods that meets the requirement for \\na healthy diet, after having accounted for the \\nportion of their income they have to reserve for \\nacquiring all basic needs other than food. \\nHow it is reported:  The main indicator (denominated \\n“prevalence of unaffordability” [PUA] ) is an \\nestimate of the percentage of individuals in a \\npopulation whose disposable income, net of the \\namount needed to acquire all basic non-food goods \\nand services, is lower than the minimum cost of \\na healthy diet. National estimates are obtained \\nby contrasting the country-specific income \\ndistributions against a threshold ( r) obtained \\nby summing the cost of a healthy diet with the \\nrelevant cost of basic non-food needs ( n). Along \\nwith the PUA, the number of people unable to \\nafford a healthy diet (NUA) is also computed by \\nmultiplying PUA by the reference population size. \\nThe entire series (2017–2022) of PUA and NUA \\nestimates are revised with each new edition of this \\nreport to reflect new cost data, new population \\ndata, and updated income distributions. As this \\nprocess usually implies backward revisions of the \\nentire PUA and NUA series, readers are advised \\nto refrain from comparing series across different \\neditions of this report and should always refer \\nto the current edition of the report, including for \\nvalues in past years. \\nMethodology:  To estimate the PUA in a population, \\na daily per capita cost threshold is computed \\nfor each country. Due to the lack of information \\nto determine the country-specific cost of basic \\nnon-food goods and services, differences in \\nthe non-food spending are based on the four \\nWorld Bank country income classification \\ngroups. Therefore, the daily per capita cost \\nthreshold combines the cost of a healthy diet \\nin a country i  and the basic cost of non-food \\nneeds for the income group j  to which country\\xa0i  \\nbelongs.  The resulting cost threshold r i is \\ndetermined as follows:\\nri\\xa0=\\xa0ci\\xa0+\\xa0nj,'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 238, 'page_label': '207'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\n| 207 |\\nwhere ci is the cost of a healthy diet in a country, \\nand nj is the cost of basic non-foods for income \\ngroup j.

Based on this definition, \\nfour food security dimensions can be identified: \\nfood availability, economic and physical access \\nto food, food utilization, and stability over \\ntime. The concept of food security is evolving \\nto also recognize the centrality of agency and \\nsustainability (see Food security dimensions \\n[e] and [f] below for the definition of these two \\nadditional dimensions).\\nFood sec urity dimensions\\nIn this report, food security dimensions refer to \\nthe four traditional dimensions of food security: \\na. Availability – This dimension addresses \\nwhether or not food is actually or potentially \\nphysically present, including aspects of \\nproduction, food reserves, markets and \\ntransportation, and wild foods.\\nb. Access – If food is actually or potentially \\nphysically present, the next question is \\nwhether or not households and individuals \\nhave sufficient physical and economic \\naccess to that food.\\nc. Utilization – If food is available and \\nhouseholds have adequate access to it, the\\xa0next \\nquestion is whether or not households are \\nmaximizing the consumption of adequate \\nnutrition and energy. Sufficient energy \\nand nutrient intake by individuals is the \\nresult of good caring and feeding practices, \\nfood preparation, dietary diversity and \\nintra-household distribution of food, and \\naccess to clean water, sanitation and health \\ncare. Combined with good biological \\nutilization of food consumed, this determines \\nthe nutritional status of individuals.\\nd. Stability – If the dimensions of availability, \\naccess and utilization are sufficiently met, \\nstability is the condition in which the whole \\nsystem is stable, thus ensuring that households \\nare food secure at all times. Stability issues \\ncan refer to short-term instability (which can \\nlead to acute food insecurity) or medium- \\nto long-term instability (which can lead to \\nchronic food insecurity). Climatic, economic, \\nsocial and political factors can all be a source \\nof instability. \\nThe report also refers to two additional \\ndimensions of food security that are proposed \\nby the High Level Panel of Experts of the \\nCommittee on World Food Security; however, \\nthey are not formally agreed upon by FAO or \\nothers, and an agreed upon language has not'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-16T17:11:50+02:00', 'author': 'FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO', 'moddate': '2024-09-03T11:31:37+02:00', 'title': 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/SOFI-2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 286, 'page': 254, 'page_label': '223'}, page_content='THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2024\\n| 223 |\\nbeen negotiated. However, due to their relevance \\nin the context of this report, they are included \\nhere. These two additional dimensions of food \\nsecurity are reinforced in conceptual and legal \\nunderstandings of the right to food and are \\ncurrently referred to and defined as follows: \\ne. Agency refers to the capacity of individuals \\nor groups to make their own decisions about \\nwhat foods they eat, what foods they produce, \\nand how that food is produced, processed and \\ndistributed within food systems; and to their \\nability to engage in processes that shape food \\nsystem policies and governance. 64\\nf. Sustainability refers to the long-term ability of \\nagrifood systems to provide food security and \\nnutrition in a way that does not compromise \\nthe economic, social and environmental bases \\nthat generate food security and nutrition for \\nfuture generations. 36 \\nForeign d irect investment\\nInvestment made by a private entity resident \\nin one economy in an enterprise resident in \\nanother. The investment must involve a long-term \\nrelationship and reflect a lasting interest \\nand control, it must be an equity investment \\n(or\\xa0reinvested earnings or intracompany loan) \\nrather than an intercompany loan, and it must be \\nmade directly rather than through capital markets.\\nFunding\\nThe money that lenders and equity holders \\nprovide to a business for daily and long-term \\nneeds. A company’s capital funding consists of \\nboth debt (bonds) and equity (stock). The business \\nuses this money for operating capital. The bond \\nand equity holders expect to earn a return on \\ntheir investment in the form of interest, dividends \\nand stock appreciation. 37\\nGovernance  \\nFormal and informal rules, organizations and \\nprocesses through which public and private \\nactors articulate their interests and make and \\nimplement decisions. 38\\nGuarantee\\nA risk-sharing agreement under which a \\nguarantor agrees to pay part or the entire amount \\ndue on a loan, equity or other instrument to a \\nlender/investor in the event of non-payment \\nby the borrower, or loss of value in case \\nof investment. 22\\nHazard\\nA process, phenomenon or human activity that \\nmay cause loss of life, injury or other health \\nimpacts, property damage, social and economic \\ndisruption or environmental degradation. 39 \\nHealthy diets\\nSee diet quality definition. \\nHealth taxes\\nExcise taxes levied on products that have a negative \\npublic health impact. These are taxes targeting \\nspecific products, such as foods of high energy \\ndensity and minimal nutritional value, to increase \\ntheir relative cost compared to nutritious foods, \\nthus reducing their consumption and preventing \\nor mitigating these negative health outcomes \\nwhile generating resources for government budgets.40\\nHealthy f ood environments\\nFood environment refers to the physical, \\neconomic, sociocultural and policy conditions \\nthat shape access, affordability, safety and food \\npreferences.

\\nIN ALL ITS FORMS\\nSix years away from 2030, hunger and food insecurity trends are not yet moving in the right direction to \\nachieve the goal of ending hunger and food insecurity (SDG Target 2.1) by 2030. The indicators of \\nprogress towards global nutrition targets similarly show that the world is not on track to eliminate all \\nforms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2). Billions of people still lack access to nutritious, safe and \\nsufficient food. The challenges are many, but progress in many countries provides hope that it is possible \\nto get back on track towards a world free of hunger and malnutrition.\\nPrevious editions of this report have identified the major drivers and underlying structural factors behind \\nthese trends and provided evidence-based policy recommendations to revert them, which have been \\ngrouped into six transformative pathways that countries can adopt, depending on the drivers and factors \\nthey are facing. \\nHowever, transiting through any of the six transformative pathways will require proper financing for food \\nsecurity and nutrition, the theme of this year’s report. Although there is a broad agreement on the urgent \\nneed to increase financing for food security and nutrition, the same cannot be said for a common \\nunderstanding regarding how this financing should be defined and tracked. This year the report provides \\na long-awaited definition of financing for food security and nutrition and guidance for its implementation. \\nThe report underlines that the data available are not enough to provide a full picture of the current \\nfinancing flows that are contributing to meet SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 and of the gap that must be filled \\nto fully meet them by 2030. The data for global official development flows are standardized and public, \\nbut a comprehensive and comparable analysis of global public spending on food and agriculture is \\nchallenged by data gaps, and private financing flows for food security and nutrition are even more \\ndifficult to track. \\nThe report provides timely and relevant recommendations regarding the efficient use of innovative \\nfinancing tools and reforms to the food security and nutrition financing architecture. Establishing a \\ncommon ground on how food security and nutrition financing is defined, along with methods for its \\ntracking, measurement and implementation, is an important first step towards sustainably increasing the \\nfinancing flows needed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, and to ensure access \\nto healthy diets for all, today and tomorrow. To this end, insights of this report are particularly important \\nin light of the next Summit of the Future in September 2024 and the Fourth International Conference on \\nFinancing for Development in June and July 2025.\\n2024\\nThe State of Food Security \\nand Nutrition in the World 2024 \\n(supplementary material)')]\n",

      "4. Lack of access to and unaffordability of nutritious foods (and unhealthy food environments)\n",
      "   - Limited physical and economic access to diverse, nutritious foods — together with environments that promote unhealthy, cheap options — undermines diets.\n",
      "5. High and persistent inequality and structural poverty\n",
      "   - Unequal access to land, inputs, markets and services means vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected.\n",
      "6. Protracted crises and insufficient financing/coordination\n",
      "   - Many countries face long‑running crises where humanitarian and development responses are underfunded or poorly integrated.\n",
      "(Evidence: SOFI 2024 highlights unaffordability and unhealthy food environments as underlying structural factors; reports find most protracted crisis countries experienced at least one major driver — conflict, climate extremes or economic downturn — between 2013–2022.)\n",

      "   - Diversify livelihoods: small livestock, value‑added activities, local processing cooperatives.\n",
      "   - Improve food environments: subsidize or incentivize production/distribution of nutritious foods; support fortification and school feeding; regulate promotion of unhealthy foods where feasible.\n",
      "   - Strengthen market access: roads, cold chains, aggregation points, women’s access to land/finance.\n",
      "   - Integrate humanitarian and development financing and planning to address protracted crises (as recommended by GNAFC/SOFI).\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical adaptations for low‑resource settings and local context\n",
      "- Prioritize low‑cost, high‑impact measures: cash transfers where markets exist; community seed banks; kitchen/home gardens; poultry for household nutrition and small income.\n",
      "- Use community‑based targeting and existing local institutions (women’s groups, cooperatives, faith networks) to deliver assistance.\n",
      "- Phase interventions: immediate relief, protect assets in the short term, then invest in resilience (don’t attempt all at once).\n",
      "- Tailor to culture, seasonality and market structure: choose crops and livestock that match local agroecology and local demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggested next steps and resources\n",
      "1. Rapid assessment: commission/consult IPC/CH assessment, market price monitoring, SMART nutrition surveys or WFP/FAO rapid needs assessments to identify drivers locally and severity.\n",
      "2. Map actors and financing: identify existing social protection, humanitarian programmes, NGOs and government schemes to build on and avoid duplication.\n",
      "3. Prioritize interventions: based on assessment, choose top 3 actions (e.g., cash transfers, seeds distribution, school feeding) with clear targeting and monitoring indicators.\n",
      "4. Mobilize resources and coordination: engage local authorities, UN agencies (FAO, WFP, UNICEF), donors and NGOs; use humanitarian–development nexus approaches.\n",
